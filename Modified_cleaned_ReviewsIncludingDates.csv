Finally, I called HBD on 11/24/20 and left a nice voice message with my phone number but no response. WHAT IS GOING ON? IS BUSINESS THAT GOOD THAT HBD IGNORES ITS CUSTOMERS? I'll never be back . . . and I'll share my experiences with HBD with others. SAD!","

I was excited for a fun and exciting atmosphere and it was completely disappointing and boring. My friend (with a severe celiac disease) chose this place for her birthday brunch. Not only did High Banks Distillery NOT have a gluten free menu but the waitress was completely uneducated with the items that were safe her to eat. Being educated on gluten free items is an expectation for individuals within the food service industry. Our server, was uneducated, uninterested and lacked knowledge on the menu and what was available for us. I'm completely disappointed in High Banks Distillery and will not be returning.","

Once we were settled at our new table i will give a shout out to the following:1. Rose coolers- delicious and will definitely go back for this drink alone2. Nachos- very good as wellThe rest of the meal however was a disappointment. We ordered the pepper appetizer and i dont think i have ever had to send something back to the kitchen until this moment. We assumed since we took 1 bite this wouldn't be charged to us, but unfortunately it was. The grilled cheese also had a bitter taste. All in all the food was probably a B-, C+. The service was the part that failed the most. We sat many times with empty drinks for 20+ minutes. Finally we agreed to leave and it took us 45 minutes to flag our server down. We asked to split the bills and i asked to have the birthday girls tab put onto my bill. Somehow, all of our checks were the exact same amount, but no detailed receipt was given so we honestly have no clue what we paid for. again, all of us at that table have worked at restaurants, and i have never even taken the time for a review on any restaurant but i was highly disappointed with this experience. if you do go- i recommend you sit outside (if allowed), get the rose coolers and nachos and close your tabs early and go to somewhere that will give you much more bang for your buck and a place that makes you feel welcomed.","

Yeah, that was pretty much my experience with Harvest. I got a duck burger, and my friend got a pizza, and neither amounted to much food relative to the cost. The duck burger was a wonderful surprise, but I ate it all in three or four bites, and when I tried the pizza, I felt like it was TOTALLY overrated. Seriously, I was expecting some flavor-profile-bliss from the way people go on and on about this, but it was meh to me. So I literally left hungry, poorer, and underwhelmed. Best thing I can say is that the decor was charming and the other diners seemed at ease and in love with life, just happy to be there. Might be a lovely spot to get coffee or a glass of wine/cocktail.","

When we received the bill there was a charge for Sprite on the check. When we inquired about the charge the server stated that the owner charges for the CO2 in the soda water! Excuse me?! First, she might have told me that before hand. Second, are you kidding me?! No restaurant in the world charges for CO2. Not to mention $2.60 for it. They make plenty of money charging $2.60 for people that actually drink pop!! You might as will charge people for using toilet paper when they use the restroom. Even Wendy's doesn't charge you for a paper cup and the water in it when you're eating in their restaurant. This is just the cost of doing business.

I went in with some friends for work at about 12:30am, and when we ordered our drinks our server brought us the wrong drink on three separate occasions. She was genuinely flustered, but was such a sweetheart we didn't mind too much. At about 2, a half hour before close, they did a last call. I received my drink at 2:10am, to which their manager told me I only had a minute to drink my full drink. I work in the industry, and I know with hours until 2:30 and legal laws saying I have until 2:30 to finish my drink, I was put off by this. He then sat at my table and made me chug my drink 20 minutes before close, which seriously pissed me off. The management staff has serious issues, and for that reason I will never be giving my money to them again.","

We went recently to this place, after we saw that they were supposed to be dog-friendly. Right away I experienced a lack of friendliness as I spoke with a hostess inside. There was a curt statement that we needed to order at the counter inside and then sit outside. Then, as my wife and my daughter and I sat outside with our little dog, a waitress came and told us that dogs were not allowed. (Please note this review is NOT about the fact that they said dogs are not allowed, even though we read that dogs were allowed. It is ABOUT their lack of respect for us as customer, perhaps even discriminatory against us.) We responded saying that we read that dogs were allowed and that is why we came. In the meantime we had ordered our food. Then a waiter came back and told us we could not sit there because dogs are not allowed. We said why not let us sit and we will leave as soon as our food is ready. He told us that a lot of people are now coming in and that any food-pickup customers, meaning us, had to wait in the Parking Lot. We told the guy we had read that dogs were allowed. Instead of apologizing for the bad information he said he was not responsible what people may have put on the internet. So there we were standing in the Parking Lot waiting for the food, while we had paid just as much as any of the other people sitting comfortably on the seating areas of the place. WE EXPERIENCED VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE at this place.","

Knowing that some restaurants mark gluten free items, but don't always have safe kitchen practices for a person with celiac or severe gluten intolerance, I always call ahead to verify before going out. If I'm uncomfortable with the procedures in place for cross-contamination, I simply don't go to that restaurant. Not a big deal. That being said, when I called Katalina's, I spoke to Tyler who was extremely rude when I explained my sensitivity, exclaiming ""you're that sensitive and you go out to eat?"" I've not had a conversation with a restaurant before that was so demeaning and judgmental. I am well aware that any time I step into a restaurant that also serves glutenous items, I am at risk of getting sick, but I do my best to live a life as close to normal as possible. Doing so has taught me a lot. I have learned that some places are safer than others, and it's ok to avoid the ones that are designed only to accommodate people that are gluten free by choice. I don't expect every restaurant to have dedicated space or kitchenware for those with food allergies. I do, however, expect every restaurant to be kind about it.If you are gluten sensitive or have celiac disease, this is not the place for you. Their verbal response alone says that they don't care about you. This one is not worth the risk.","

This place was great before it was turned into a creepy funeral parlor inside. Who puts an oil painting of a dead grand mother on the wall and paints the walls black with a funeral home-style chandelier obscuring the menu? You're either trying too hard to be cool, or you're one sick puppy. The place was kind of disturbing, but that was just the beginning.The girl behind the counter just stared at me with a blank gaze as she wore her 70's rock band t-shirt and made no attempt to smile. I had a hard time trying to figure out what I should order, as the menu has changed drastically since back when they were just known as Cafe Corner, the friendly, attitude-free neighborhood sandwich cafe. Her attitude was off-putting, and it took a cool 20 minutes to get my flat little sandwich with a tiny bag of chips and a drink for $15!!!!!!!!! The reuben style sandwich was only ok but it really made me miss the stuff they used to offer before ownership changed hands. The KATALINA sign outside looks really hokey, as well, like some sort of circus feel. The only redeeming thing is the breakfast burrito, which is huge and tasty, and if you get there early enough, you can get one and avoid the rush of yuppies that this place attracts.Other than that, save your money and find another place, like Brown Bag, Commonwealth, or Katzingers.

The menu has been dumbed down, most of the good dishes gone or only available on Sunday and Monday. They still can't time the food delivery, with substantial waits between courses. Prices are way up and food quality way down. The $56 ribeye special wasn't a ribeye, wasn't prime and was so tough you could barely chew it; the Brussels sprouts were mush; the mashed potatoes had golf ball sized lumps of uncooked potato; they didn't honor a request to leave the pecans out of a salad; the burger was cold. The server didn't even clear the table before they brought the check. To be avoided.","

Last night, a group of friends and I visited Third and Hollywood on my wife's birthday. Shortly after being seated, we ordered two bottles of wine for the table.  During a long wait for the wine, we asked our server several times about the delay and we were assured it was on its way out any moment. It was over a half hour at this point, as we cheered my wife's birthday with glasses of water, that I approached the bar and asked to speak to a manager. I was asked my name, which I found odd, but I complied and was told the manager would talk to me when available. In about 10 minutes the manager did stop by our table and we shared we'd been waiting about 45 minutes for our wine order. Her very first question to us was if John (not using his real name) was our waiter. I didn't know his name but one of our friends was able to confirm, yes, it was John. The manager then said that John had episodes of low blood sugar and it was critical she leave us and check on him. I said absolutely, make sure he's okay. A different server arrived a bit later, we reordered our wine (had to order 2X with new server), and ultimately it was brought to our table. About a half hour or more passed when the manager came back to our table. She was immediately defensive, before we said anything, and border line rude as she again told us about John's condition and blood sugar; John was the focus, not us. We were not the bad guys in this situation and being spoken down to was not appreciated. Whereas a simple apology and a little empathy that my wife's birthday dinner was as train wreck would have sufficed. And just to be clear, no apology was offered.The point is that the restaurant is acutely aware that one of its employees has a medical challenge (and I think it's great that they accommodate it). But instead of being ready to handle easily foreseeable business flow problems, it is an issue for the customers, not the restaurant. All the staff seemed bothered and annoyed (some may say rude) dealing with us over the whole affair. We were never asked if we'd like to order dinner during the hours we spent at the table, so we simply paid and left. By the way, I noticed that John was carrying on his duties when we departed, so good to see he was fine.Lastly, a big THANK YOU to The Avenue Steak Tavern in Grandview. We went there after Third and Hollywood since we had gone without dinner and were famished. The Avenue kept their kitchen open past its normal closing time so we could order. Amazing food and service at The Avenue and my wife's birthday was saved!","

A classy looking place that smelled good walking into. After we were seated our waiter came over and gave us this look like he could've cared less and just wanted to get through the rest of his shift. I get it man, you don't wanna be here, maybe you're having a bad day or some rich asshole didn't leave you the tip you deserved. I've waited tables too so I can't really fault the guy too much for having to be around a snobby clientele like that but at least pretend to give a fuck. Now the appetizer was OK (chicken chili dip nothing particularly mind blowing) but I got the ""Righteous Pork Chop"" at the waiters suggestion (I really wanted to like him I swear) and what I ended up with was a tiny pork chop (Quality over quantity sure) seasoned lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, braised cabbage which didn't help accent anything being that it was completely flavorless and a roasted pear cause yeah ok lets roast a pear and feature that as a side item!!! (I'm not saying the pear thing couldn't work but holy shit hows that supposed to count as a side, I mean do something with it! Maybe use it to accent the plainest pork chop in the world some how) Though the pork chop was cooked Properly and had really good looking grill marks, but it did nothing for me upon eating it. This pork chop was the equivalent of having an indecisive girlfriend who says I don't care to every question shes asked. The waiter never once checked on us to see if the food was ok and we didn't see him till the end of our meal when he dropped off the check. (but hey man again, shit happens I'm sorry about whatever happened) In short you can have a nice place, with all the bells and whistles but the food is what everyone is leaving with. So as I write this review from my toilet seat right now because I haven't stopped having explosive diarrhea since the meal, I'd like to say maybe it was an off night for them or maybe its something that just wasn't meant for me but as far as I'm concerned this place is a turd in a gold wrapper. I give every place two chances before I cut it from the list, this is strike one and we will see what happens next time. P.s. We had to go to MACS bar and grill and Jeni's to the taste out of our mouths, which MACS has the best wedge salad in town and everybody knows the Jeni's is good.","

I love the grilled artichoke, and the Friday mussels special is my favorite food in all of Columbus. I've never had any food that was less than outstanding at this restaurant, and in the past have always had exceptional service too. Unfortunately, I recently had a pretty disappointing experience there. I was dining on a Friday night with 6 friends. We ordered a couple of appetizers to share, and everyone had entrees. We had a round of drinks. Upon ordering a second round of drinks, my friend asked that the House Margarita be made with a dash more tequila than the first. We were informed that with the ""premixed drinks"" it is impossible to adjust the quantity of liquor. This seemed a little far fetched (and also, 3rd and Hollywood, pre-mixed?) so she then asked for an ounce of tequila along with her premixed margarita, and clearly indicated that she would be willing to pay for it. We were informed that the bar does not serve shots. At this point it had become absurd, so to add to the absurdity, I ordered a glass of tequila, neat. I was informed that I was not allowed to have two drinks at once (I had about 2 sips of wine left in my glass). We asked to speak to the manager because all of these policies seemed arbitrary and ludicrous. It might have been one thing had we only been drinking or if we were acting disruptive, but we had just eaten an enormous dinner and no one was acting intoxicated. The manager came over with a preemptively rude demeanor and told us that if we wanted to be in ""the kind of establishment that serves shots, we should go to one of the many other places nearby."" She further stated that their policy regarding not having multiple drinks at once is 1) to preserve the ambience of the establishment and 2) for our safety. Again, I can see either of these coming into play had any of us been acting like we'd had more than one drink. But we hadn't and we weren't. The final straw for me was when we expressed disappointment in their policies and her attitude; my friend (and neighbor) informed her that we all live in the neighborhood, dine out incredibly often, and likely wouldn't return to 3rd and Hollywood, to which this manager replied ""well, that's your choice and we're doing just fine.""Still a huge fan of the food, less of a fan of the condescending and paternalistic attitude by management.","

I'm a huge fan of Northstar and had high expectations for Third & Hollywood, however, my experience left a lot to be desired.I'll start with the positives...  The ambiance is nice enough and the wait staff is friendly and accommodating. Our waiter was timely and efficient. The cheddar biscuits were delicious and my glass of Pinot Grigio hit the spot.That's about it for the positives. The menu is completely over priced especially considering the sign outside reads: Bar & Grill. I was expecting more of a ""Bar & Grill"" type menu and prices. I'm not the type of person to hold back from ordering the most expensive item on the menu and don't have a problem spending money on going to dinner - in fact I'm going to Hyde Park for dinner this weekend and dined at Smith & Wollensky just last week. I was very excited about the Fish Sandwich at $16 consisting of grilled tilapia with an aioli sauce when I initially ordered. It wasn't until I took a bite into the raw fish that I almost vomited and lost my appetite. I eat enough fish to know that tilapia must be prepared thoroughly, unlike perhaps tuna or even salmon. I'm not one to complain or send food back very often and felt uncomfortable doing so, although it was necessary.My boyfriend's burger and fries at $13 was edible. It's hard to screw up a burger, but it wasn't anything to write home about. This is what I ended up with for my meal, not something I would typically order at a restaurant but I knew it would be safe. If I want a good burger I'm going to Thurman's, Jack's or even Wendy's - famous for great burgers and not $13!!  I have to say, our waiter was sympathetic and didn't hesitate to take away the raw fish and offer another menu selection, which was much appreciated. He could have been somewhat apologetic and I was surprised when he brought us the bill that he felt it necessary to acknowledge he took the fish sandwich off. I obviously expected the fish sandwich to be taken off the bill. They could have done a better job with service recovery, especially being new and trying to establish a good reputation. It would have been nice if they would have at least offered a complimentary dessert or offered my second meal at no charge. Had that happened, I may consider going back and wouldn't be writing this review. Instead, we were charged $42 (not including tip) for two burgers and fries, and one glass of wine. I said nothing, paid the bill and tipped the waiter my standard 20%.If I want to spend $42 on dinner I'm not going to go back to Third & Hollywood. There are so many fantastic restaurants in Grandview. If I want meatloaf and mashed potatoes, I'll go to Red Door Tavern. If I want a good steak, seafood, or Italian cuisine I'll go to Spagio, Trattoria Roma, Z Cucina, Figlio, Thom's, Shoku, etc. For a sandwich and beer I'll hit up Jimmy V's, Old Bag of Nails, Knotty Pine... the list goes on, all places I will go before going back to Third & Hollywood. It's very unfortunate and I hate to be so critical, but I was very disappointed and feel compelled to save others from the same disappointment. Don't do it!!","

For starters it was so so hot inside. I had plans to host a group around 6 and got there by 3 to make sure everything was situated before they arrived, I was told the high tops are first come first serve, I got one only to see a ""reserved"" sign placed on my table my 5. When I inquired what that was about, I was told they were still honoring previous reservations prior to them cancelling the ability to make reservations. Of course I didn't have it and stood my ground given I was oblivious to this and explained I was arriving way ahead of time to the host. The manager eventually let me have the table. Not a good first time experience. Plus it was hot beyond measure. Its overhyped. Definitely never going back because there should be more to a fancy lounge than a great view methinks.","

My friends and I wanted to go out to somewhere nice for an evening so we chose Lincoln Social. It was a really fun night. We all got some food and drinks and chatted for a while. When it came time to pay our bills, they all looked fine. Everyone's bills were accurate. So we all gave the server our cards to pay. When the server came back with our cards, I noticed that the server used my card to pay for my friend's bill that was significantly more expensive than mine. We told the server this, but he seemed to be in a rush to leave, so he advised me that he will have it fixed since the bills were correct, payment methods were just not correct for each individual bill. He seemed nice and trustworthy so I trusted that. The next day I noticed that the charges were not fixed when I looked at my credit card charges. I called Lincoln Social and explained what happened and whoever I spoke to was very rude - asking me the exact names of drinks that I ordered, ect. Point is, your employee charged me for a bill that was not mine. He had already swiped my card for a bill that I did not agree too. And went further to tell me he would fix it, and it was not fixed.Since Lincoln Social was not willing to dispute, I went through my credit card company who is still going back and forth with Lincoln Social to this day trying to get this disputed. I am not one to be petty about things like this but this is terrible customer service. Let me remind you this was back in December - January, and it is now April. I will never go back or support this business. I have worked in the service industry for years, and if a customer complains about something like this, they are always listened to. This is totally uncalled for.","

We arrived right before our reservation time to discover that not only was a table not set up and we had to wait for over 5 minutes, but when we were finally seated we were told the kitchen was closing at 9:00 PM. This, of course, caused some confusion and concern and we asked, ""Why were we not told this when we were making the reservation?""  We certainly would have made other arrangements. The waitress herself was pleasant but perplexed and asked the management and kitchen if we could proceed with our ordering. After some discussion, we decided to stay and order but our waitress did not come for our orders.  I got the attention of a person who had been discussing the situation with our waitress (I believe this was a manager -a tall slender blonde) and asked if we could order now since the kitchen was closing soon and her response to me was ""THERE'S NO NEED TO BE COMBATIVE"". This, of course, made the decision for us and we picked up our entire party and went to The Eagle where we showed up unannounced and were accommodated immediately, happily and professionally with zero issue. Never once did anyone at The Pearl give us an answer as to why we weren't informed about the kitchen close time or apologize for the mix-up. The waitress and the hostess seemed apologetic regarding the situation but the Manager seemed very annoyed that we were there at all. She set a very bad example to the entire staff.  What would have immediately diffused the situation? The manager (or anyone really) should have walked to our table unprompted, apologize for the mix up and let us know they were happy to accept our business and wish us a good night.  This would have ended the entire thing. It's amazing really, how little effort on the behalf of the restaurant could have prevented this bad review and the fact that between the 10 of us ...that's a lot of discussion about where NOT TO GO!

I could list them all but the low point was probably the pork cheek or venison. The flavor profiles are off and the food is under seasoned. With the bold colors and combinations that roll out you expected your palate to be doing gymnastics to keep up - instead you get a bland yawn. Honestly, everything is always cooked to the right temperature but it literally comes down to taste - there isn't much.  I  Not to mention, you are paying $30-40 an entree. Pretty steep. If you want exotic game - stick to Refectory's antelope course which blows their venison out of the water.In sum, I think this place suffers from an identity crisis. If they stuck with the great beer and creative and flavorful small plate appetizers for sharing and maybe upscale bar food/sandwiches it would be perfect. But instead they do quasi-fine dining courses that our outrageously over priced (but more importantly, the dishes aren't executed). Really cool place so i hope they do some self-reflection soon.","

If you want to wait ""10-15 min""... really 25-30min for an over priced average bagel sandwich then you have found your sanctuary. The service was slow and flooded with online orders which they were not able to maintain pace with. Personally, If I were open an establishment I would prioritize the customers who are willing to come into the store rather than online. Overall, if you are looking for a great breakfast sandwich go to Bruggers, get 2 of the western bagel sandwiches and you'll be home and have ate before you go your food at Lox.","

Yes, you read this right. A bagel with a little smoked salmon and onion costs $12. The bagel itself tastes fine and the sandwich overall isn't bad but it is still a small (their bagels are on the small side) simple sandwich. We also had their egg salad sandwich and it was as simple as you can imagine. The eggs salad was eggs and mayo. That's is. We paid $20+ for that lunch and immediately went to have another lunch at another place (north market). Otherwise, the people there were very nice and the restaurant is clean (although traffic and parking is a nightmare).

First I was disappointed on the selection of items...I selected a piece of all sausages offered to include Bahama Mama...mashed red skinned potato, meatloaf, brown gravy, red cabbage, sauerkraut, German potato salad, and potato soup.  Nothing had flavor. The red skinned mashed potato was tasteless, no garlic, no butter....no flavor The kraut was certainly not homemade and also tasteless, red cabbage had a predominate clove blast of overpowering spice. The German Potato Salad, lacked the bite of Cider Vinegar, and smokiness of bacon that German Potato Salad is supposed to have.... I believe the potato soup was a package, just add boiling water mix...The slivers of potato were reconstituted, with a dehydrated institutional flavor. The soup itself was pure starch, with no flavor..... The theme here is no flavor. The Bahama Mama, sausage?....well....for me a disappointment.

This was our first time, Basi being a place we've been meaning to get to for a while. Even in winter the patio is gorgeous, and I can only imagine what a magical experience it would be dining there in the summer.I forget the name of our bartender/server but she was great. Sometimes I find that the service at some of these super established restaurants can be a little off, mostly due to the fact that they probably get all the business they need and then some. Not the case here. She was warm, inviting and extremely helpful.Started off with a couple plates of the Zucchini Pronto(?), basically finely sliced zucchini, almonds mixed with spices and olive oil and covered with cheese. Divine. I could have consumed a few bowls of that myself.Moved on to the short ribs, salmon and eggplant Parmesan. Parmesan and ribs were great, the salmon was so-so. I'm not sure how they cook it or where they source from, but the taste of the fish itself was lacking. I can't knock them too much for it though because bland-tasting fish is a common theme when you're in the midwest. There are only a very few places that really present a piece of fish that truly pops.Other than that, we left happy campers and can't wait to get back as soon as the weather turns warm. This is definitely a place that deserves its long-standing reputation as a city gem, and that's something that a lot of the other mainstay restaurants in Columbus can't claim. Can't wait to get back in the spring.","

I account for delivery time, and to their credit, both bowls were still steaming and piping hot. I expect the shiru(broth) to be soaked into the rice because it is delivered, no problem. The flavor could have been better, seeming slightly weak. The quality control was non-existent. The first bowl had almost no egg, like they were afraid to use it. The second was a normal amount. Where are the onions? I know not everyone puts bamboo shoots in, so that is fine, but ONIONS please. There could have been a bit more broth, particularly with a weaker flavor. There were no green onions, offsetting an otherwise muted visual appearance with some brightness. No sesame seeds, as displayed in their own photo of the dish. While I don't expect food to mirror pictures, I DO expect it to include the same ingredients. To give a comparison of this dish, it was like expecting a Burger King Whopper or Dave's Classic from Wendy's and getting a Rally's Cheese Champ. Underperforming, but this was actually not the worst part....No chopsticks. I received forks, like some uncultured amateur. It may seem minor, but my feelings on this are so strong because it changes the experience. Perhaps I am a bit elitist when I say ""Who goes to Japanese and uses forks?"" but this is Bonsai, not Pete's Teriyaki(actually a real place, good Americanized teriyaki over rice). The very name Bonsai drips so much of culture, patience and attention to detail that if I entered the establishment, I would be expecting to hear a koto playing, with falling water in the background. Bonsai, named after a refined art that captures both Japanese spirit and refinement, steeped in harmony, and I GET FORKS. The more I ate, stabbing at my dish, one resentful impalement after another, the more I realized how much it upset me. I genuinely hope that everyone has a much better experience than I did, and I hope that this lapse in attention to detail does not represent what Bonsai has to offer.","

"The Guild House","https://www.yelp.com/not_recommended_reviews/the-guild-house-columbus?not_recommended_start=0","False","Amina M.",1,"2024-02-19","Entering The Guild House, my anticipation for a delightful dining experience was met with disappointment and discomfort. While the ambiance and cuisine showed promise, the atmosphere was marred by instances of rudeness and unwarranted confrontation, overshadowing the culinary offerings.Upon arrival, the decor and ambiance of The Guild House set a welcoming tone. The elegant interior and inviting lighting created a pleasant environment for patrons to enjoy their meals. However, any semblance of hospitality quickly dissipated as interactions with the staff unfolded.Regrettably, our experience was marred by the behavior of a server named Tianna. Throughout the meal, Tianna exhibited a concerning lack of professionalism and courtesy. Her demeanor towards our party was dismissive and bordering on confrontational, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere that detracted from the dining experience. Not only was she rude, but her facial expressions betrayed a clear disdain for her role and for serving customers.Furthermore, our discomfort was compounded when, upon receiving the bill, we were met with unwelcome scrutiny regarding our tip. While tipping is a customary practice to acknowledge exceptional service, it is not an obligation, especially when service falls short of expectations. However, our decision not to tip generously was met with outright hostility from the staff, culminating in a public confrontation that left us feeling embarrassed and disrespected.To add insult to injury, Tianna's behavior extended to the handling of our plates. Instead of clearing the table with care and attentiveness, she tossed our plates aside with apparent disregard for our dining experience. Such actions only served to further sour our perception of The Guild House and its staff.Even more distressing was the response from the manager when we attempted to address our concerns. Instead of offering a sincere apology or attempting to rectify the situation, the manager berated us, further exacerbating the tension and leaving us feeling unwelcome and unappreciated.It's disheartening to see a restaurant with such potential for excellence fall short due to the behavior of its staff. While the cuisine may have been commendable, the overall experience was marred by the unprofessional conduct of certain employees. In an industry built on hospitality and customer service, instances of rudeness, confrontational behavior, and managerial negligence should never be tolerated.In conclusion, while The Guild House may boast an appealing menu and inviting ambiance, it fails to deliver a truly enjoyable dining experience due to issues with staff professionalism and customer service. As patrons, we expect to be treated with respect and courtesy, and unfortunately, our experience fell far short of these expectations.","

We were greeted by a rude hostess who neglected to notify us that we could order drinks or appetizers at the bar while we waited for our table (even though we had a reservation). After our wait, we were seated at a folding table near the bar. We received our food quickly however, it was barely even hot upon its arrival. As a result, we decided to skip dessert or extra drinks and get out of there as soon as possible. Our experience at The Guild House was highly disappointing for what we thought would a high-end dining experience, and not worth our money. We regret not going to Cap City Diner instead, as we would have eaten much better food at a lower cost and been treated with better service.","

My party arrived 20 minutes early for a 3 o'clock reservation. At 3:15 I asked how much longer the wait would be and learned that two parties with 2:45 reservations would have to be seated first, so my party would be delayed longer. We were eventually seated a little after 3:30.Two members of my party decided to order from the regular menu, but it required three requests to get a gluten-free dinner menu, not a breakfast menu. Our waiter took our orders a little after 4pm. I ordered the prix fixe Thanksgiving meal: soup, salad, turkey entrée and pumpkin dessert.My dinner got off to a good start with the squash bisque and I looked forward to the rest of the meal. One of my dinner companions received a salad and I urged her to start to eat it, since I was sure mine would be served soon. My salad never arrived and it became apparent it had been given to my tablemate (I chose to say nothing to avoid embarrassing her and the waiter). I may not have missed much, however, because she gave up on the salad after tasting it.The most intense disappointment was the turkey entrée. It was barely more than a skimpy chef's salad. My portion had 8 to 10 half-inch cubes of turkey with some diced tomatoes and uninspired dressing. There were some mashed potatoes and something green (I can't remember what). Dessert was ice cream (good) and some pumpkin concoction (forgettable). I left the table hungry after an overpriced meal.My party has enjoyed dining at several Mitchell restaurants, including on special occasions and holidays. This was our first experience at The Guild House and will be our last. It was a sad lesson in how not to celebrate the bounty of the land.","

Here are my thoughts:Positives: Tuesday's are $1 per and all other days are $1.75. They have a full bar, live music and a HUGE selection of Pierogi, including meat, vegetarian and vegan options. Slightly odd hours (7pm-2am)The one or two negative things about the place:It was dirtier than an open, trench-dug latrine after being used by a platoon of the morbidly obese suffering from explosive diarrhea.The workers were about as pleasant as some demon-spawn that crawled out of Satan's ass, curled up in a corner, died and was left to molder and rot. Well, that's not entirely true...they didn't even approach being that tolerable.So, if a side of dysentery served with cheap Pierogi by some rude, hag-ridden battleaxe is your idea of good eats, then have at!

They actually looked at me 1st, I explained everything to the bartenders and he came over again and again, These people did NOTHING to help me, they did not stand up for me or even get a manager, even his friend tried to get him but he was too ""into"" me to pay attention to the ques. The manager Chip even stared at me from the corner of the bar at the last instance and you guessed it NOTHING. I could not even enjoy my overpriced meal, I felt horrible and I felt like had I spoke up for myself I would look like black girl gone mad especially because my hair was fro like, no other black people were in the area that I could see besides the workers and i was just felt defeated. I was dying inside and everyone knew it from the look on my face and my body language. The guy and the girl bartender made comments on the guys behavior but NEVER while he was there. It made me so horribly sad I can barely explain. Had I been a blonde hair woman and a big 6ft3 black man was harassing me, and feeling me up NO DOUBT in my mind the way things would have changed. The way I was left to hang with this old ass white man doing and saying whatever he wanted to me in an establishment like this will bother me forever. I tried to handle this with grace and I feel like I failed myself and I should have lost it. I go to the most high-end of places almost 4 times a week Smith &Wollensky, Guild-house, The Pearl just to name a few and I also bartend at a very nice restaurant I will not name and NEVER would I EVER had been treated like this or let any of my customers feel this way. I am crying right now just as I did after leaving this place after I spoke to the manager CHIP, that night to no true prevail. Only to say it is a learning curve for his staff and he will talk to them. WTF I am a human, and a woman who was dining alone and was in open view harassed by a man with his wife that was 3 chairs away. Why would the bar staff allow this???? I spoke to them and told them what he was saying and how creeped out I was. What kind of a mess of an ""upscale diner is this??? Honestly,​ I was shaking because I know how little the world thinks of me because I am a black woman but this undoubtedly will be stamped in my mind forever as the WORST DINING EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE.P.S The creepy old man asked if I wanted a drink I rolled my eyes and he goes on to pay for my meal after seeing how irritated I was, and this bartender says at least he paid for your meal. Readers, please listen clearly, on 1 hand I am proud of myself for not reacting, but you have no idea how much I wanted to jump across that bar when she said that as if I was some dirty tramp that was out looking to get felt up for a FREE MEAL, ... I was FURIOUS as hell. I got on snap chat and cried to my friends literally about my experience all the way to my car and had to wait 20 mins to get myself together before I could drive. WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER FROM A WOMAN THAT FINE DINES 4+ DAYS PER WEEK, 2X COLLEGE GRAD, SOCIAL BUTTERFLY, AND ALSO A FOOD SERVICE WORKER............","

The best part of our meal was the seafood, which, while fantastic, is disappointing in a self-professed 'steakhouse'. I will note that I am admittedly very picky about steak: if I can make it better at home, in not going to be happy.For this visit, I passed on my planned Hatchet order after being recommended to not go less than medium rare. Since I much prefer rare/blue, I instead went with the Japanese A5 Wagyu, a cut I've heard much about but had not had an opportunity to taste. Our waitress recommended, and confirmed with the chef, that rare would be best for this. What came out was actually cold rather than cool (they did offer to take it back and 'warm it up' but by this point I was mostly done with the lackluster experience), but mostly tasty until halfway through when it turned to gristle. Careful trimming got some remaining meat off, but I would guess about a quarter of the 4oz order was waste.My wife ordered a 'cowboy steak' medium rare. Inside the steak was closer to medium, but mostly tasty and tender. Outside, however, consisted of an extra thick coating of burnt char with the taste of charcoal. Not a pleasant experience, but she was willing to scrape off the less appealing/inedible bits.As I said before, the crab cake, shrimp (huge), and crab leg we had were delicious. I would pass on the Mac & cheese side (mediocre), but the asparagus was good.Service was average, at best, and far from enough to make up for the rest of the experience (especially at this price point).Updated to two stars to reflect the positives.","

I had reserved the Tatami Room ONE MONTH in advance and had called to confirm a couple weeks ago just to make sure all is well, as it's Valentine's Day and I'm well aware reservations fill quickly. With ample notice I could have made a reservation anywhere, but I have been to Ampersand and have reserved the Tatami room on a number of occasions, I enjoy the vibe and it's the reason I chose it for this specific day.I show up to see others sitting at the table. I walk up to the host to say my name and that I had a reservation. The host goes, ""uhhh for today?"" Me: ""yes, for today 5-7pm"". Host goes to talk to other employees in obvious confusion, I go sit down. Host comes back up after a few minutes and says, ""so it looks like we had two reservations for this time, and the other reservation sat down at the wrong table, but now it's too late to ask them to move, so we can sit you at another table and serve you there.""First of all, no. Second, the reason I made a reservation SO FAR in advance was because I wanted the Tatami room, not a random table near by.Between the lack of apology, the lack of accountability, and awareness I'm in utter disbelief and had to remove myself from the restaurant before creating a scene and having a breakdown.I hope y'all can get a sense of the undeniable frustrations I was feeling in that moment.

Their brunch on Sunday is unrivaled in the city, every Sunday morning I wake up and can immediately taste the flavors of my favorite dish.Having been there over five times now, however, I feel the need to point out their disturbing lack of quality service. At most of the restaurants around town that would be considered Skillet's main competition you may occasionally receive the apathetic or sassy service worker, but these things are to be expected. Often times the restaurant can simply stand on its food alone. Unfortunately Skillet seems to have hired self-loathing career waiters or people with absolutely no experience. After being forgotten, ignored, and given the wrong food on a few occasions, I decided that they had one more chance. The day that chance came was another busy Sunday brunch (if you do go on Sunday plan ahead for a long wait) and the usual chaos that results in poor planning on its waitstaff's part. Rather than have a paper list of those waiting for a table the server angrily shouted to anyone who entered that they should go wait outside and ""get in line"". There was, however, no visible line, and so potential patrons were left standing adrift. After waiting for a half hour and being told that he hoped ""we all knew our seating order"" (we did), yet before anyone could announce themselves as next, the server proceeded to choose a group that had just stumbled up without wait. Those that had waited confronted him, yet he refused to seat the parties in the correct order, calling it ""our responsibility"". Faced with closing time and another half hour wait, all but one group decided to move on to another restaurant.Verdict: Great food. A bit pricey. Terrible Service.","

There were around 40 people in attendance, which meant that there were at least ten of us who were left standing around most of the 2.5 hours that the cooking was taking place because there wasn't room for everyone to have a turn cooking at each station-it was kind of first come first serve, and once a station was full at the start, it remained full (We LOVE to cook and we only got to peel oranges for a salad). We had a lot of fun drinking wine and chatting at the dinner table once dinner started! Also the staff was wonderful-so friendly and helpful!

The Kitchen is definitely an underrated spot... they do Taco Tuesday every Tuesday night with a different theme, and it's open to the public! Outside of Tuesday nights, they are primarily closed for private functions (showers, corporate events, birthdays, etc.) other than their participatory dining experiences which you can sign up for on their website. Those are fairly expensive ($60-$80 per person) so I haven't made it to one of those yet, but it sounds like an awesome idea! And now that I've tried their food, I'm even more motivated to try it.The week I attended, the taco theme was The Muppets. No idea why, because that doesn't sound like a theme that would make sense for tacos, but they made it work! It resulted in a very colorful menu board with Muppets characters and creative menu choices. Miss Piggy had a pork belly taco, Kermit had a vegetarian option, plus many others. I was also surprised at the variety of options outside of tacos, including a salad, lemon pepper wings, quesadillas, and polenta fries. Everything was reasonably priced ($3 per taco, $4-$7 for everything else) so my bill was around $11. Not a bad deal! They also offer a variety of cocktails each week to match the theme, as well as a dessert option. Honestly though, with Jeni's, Kittie's Cakes, and Pistachia Vera all within a mile, it will be difficult for you not to try one of those afterwards...As for the space, it is gorgeous. It's an old brick building, and as I approached, I assumed that it would be a tiny little place like many other restaurants in German Village. I was pleasantly surprised to discover it was about 4 times larger than I anticipated, with beautiful hardwood floors, lots of open space, and even fresh cut flowers at all of the tables! It is a more casual experience as you walk up to the bar to order food/drinks and then receive a ticket to drop off to the kitchen staff. You can also get your own water from a dispenser near the kitchen, but I am not sure if they offer soft drinks. A few minutes later, your food is delivered to your table and then the real fun begins! Everyone in my group enjoyed their meal, and I thought that everything tasted very fresh. I can also tell that they put a lot of thought into coming up with creative combinations of ingredients. Bonus: you don't have to wait for your check to show up since you pay when you order, so you can head out as soon as you finish eating. My crew headed to The Book Loft down the street because it's supposedly a big touristy spot in Columbus and none of us had ever been. And it is a lot of fun! So there you go, I just planned your next weeknight adventure. You're welcome. Enjoy your tacos and books!","

When the waiter approached we told him that we would be sharing our meal and cocktail. We ordered the Ohio Sate Fair cocktail ($11 -$13). When it came out (delivered by someone other than our waiter, with 1 straw) it was a plastic glass filled with ice and very little to drink, I got approximately 2 swallows as did my friend. We stated that we were not happy with the volume of the drink for the price and they brought us another drink. We ordered a salad and specifically asked for the salad dressing on the side, when it came (delivered by someone other than our waiter)is was dressed with too much dressing and on one plate. We had 2 4-5 inch plates on the table so we were able to split it. We ordered the fish entrée ($28). Again, when it came (delivered by someone other than our waiter) it was on one plate. We kept waiting for someone to come by so that we could request another dinner plate. No one did so I went inside (we were eating at the outside patio) and asked the hostess (the only person around) if we could please have another dinner plate and a spoon. After about 10 minutes we finally divided the dinner on to the 4 in square plate, but I was not happy about eating my dinner on a tiny plate so I went back in and said I wanted to speak with our waiter immediately. The woman asked what the problem was so I explained what was happening. She said she would be right out. She showed up about 10 minutes later and offered us a dessert. I expressed my extreme dissatisfaction with having to eat my dinner on a 4 inch plate when I had politely requested a dinner plate. I finally said that I thought they should comp part of our meal. Eventually another person came to our table with a plate with 4 small chocolate truffles and told us that our meal would be totally comped. We never saw our waiter after we ordered our meal. While I appreciated the fact that they comped the meal, the whole experience ruined what would have otherwise been a very enjoyable evening. I don't mind paying for a good meal,but I expect good service, which was certainly not the case at the Watershed. I will never go back to this restaurant and I will tell all of my friends about our experience.","

When my friend asked our server if he could check on the status of our meals, he replied that he could ""if we wanted him to get in trouble for us""...what an odd thing to say?! Once our meals came (and were delivered by someone other than our server), they were lukewarm (my friend's order of shortrib was completely cold). It took a few minutes and a flagdown to get our server's attention to let him know. He boxed up my friend's short rib meal, at her request, and apologized. A manager came over and apologized and said she would be taking a round of drinks off of our bill. Our server then returned and again apologized, said this has never happened to him, but also said the kitchen and bar were slammed. Granted, it was a Friday and the restaurant did seem full, but nothing that an established place shouldn't be able to expect and handle. Regardless, he then said they would be comping all of our meals, which was a nice surprise! Despite the food being cold, my meal was mediocre and nothing special. The dilly bean appetizer, however, was delicious. The cocktail menu is fun and there is a good variety to choose from. I probably won't return, given all the other choices in the city, but I appreciate that they tried to make up for their mistakes.","

My husband and I are fans of the Watershed spirits and our liquor cabinet always sports 2 to 4 bottles. The cocktail menu is very quaint and well done graphically. It is fun to read. The cocktails are delightful but very small. SO, sip slowly.About the rest... We have been looking forward to our visit. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays, so we made special reservations for a birthday dinner. The ""kitchen"", as it is called, is dark and not unlike the current trend in restaurant design found on every street corner in Columbus. It was also extremely noisily. We were given probably the worst table in the house, even though outdoor and other seats were available. We requested a different table. The menu was only one page (yeah!) and the prices were reasonable for this type of casual upscale dining. The menu had a date on the top, which shows it changes. We ordered 6 different things from the menu and I can't say we were overwhelmed by anything. The Ham, Clams, and Taters had no potatoes and we were left with a shallow bowl of a white tasty broth. No spools, no bread. We had to request some and when it arrived, it looked like the Krogers Private Select loaf I just purchased that day. Only 2 slices, lightly toasted and buttered ( and we were not charged $1 for it as commented by another review, but at least they got a slice to start of with!). We used it to soak up the broth. I wish the bread had been a crusty French. My husbands Duck Confit was just leg portion (think large chicken leg) and somewhat tasteless. The gnocchi with walnut was well flavored. My Hay Smoked Baby Backs were served on a raised grate in an iron skillet. Around the edges was ""hay"" that had red hot embers and smoking. So! That was the burning smell coming from the kitchen! I thought it was cigarette smoke wafting in from the patio! There was a tasteless green sauce served on the side that had no purpose. The ribs themselves were very good.  The only reason to give the Watershed Kitchen 5 stars is because of their overly ambitious  menu. It is almost too esoteric. There are a lot of really great places in Columbus to eat and get really good food. They state: We make ""honest, Midwestern food"". That is not really what is on the menu. Ramps and kumquats are not Midwestern. And what is a compressed strawberry? And the burning hay was a bit much. We decided, before we left, that we were not necessary going to rush back for a second visit. I am also not so sure that it should be called one of the best new restaurant in Columbus... Of the 6 things we ordered, the ribs were the best (but, great ribs are not hard to come by in Columbus). Everything else was just ok. Even the dessert. The ""Ice Cream"" sandwich was not made with ice cream and pureed nuts looked like baby poop. I think Watershed is trying to hard. We will keep an eye on the menu. Maybe we will return. But keep up the good work with the bourbon, gin and vodka!Gawd! I hated writing this review!!","

The atmosphere of the restaurant is exactly as its name suggests - socially inviting and perfect for catching up with friends over drinks and delicious food.One thing that stood out to us was the happy hour menu, which offered half off appetizers and $3 off drinks. It was a great way to try multiple items without breaking the bank. And speaking of appetizers, the showstopper of the evening was the cheddar and scallion biscuits with honey butter (not included in the half off apps). These were so delicious that I would come back to Kitchen Social solely for them. They were warm, flaky, and just the right amount of flavour - absolutely delightful.We also tried the Crispy Thai shrimp, which had good flavour and a nice crunch. The butternut squash hummus was a unique take on traditional hummus, although personally, I still prefer the traditional version. Lastly, we ordered the Margherita pizza, which was simple yet made perfectly and tasted delicious.Overall, I highly recommend Kitchen Social for a fun and inviting atmosphere, delicious food, and a great happy hour menu. Don't miss the cheddar and scallion biscuits with honey butter - they're worth the trip alone!","

This was my worst Columbus dining experience in my 5 years living here. I was at Land Grant for a work event and really excited at the prospect of eating barbecue for dinner. I love barbecue because normally, as a celiac, I am impressed with all that I can eat at barbecue joints. I order 13$ worth of food (note the waffle fries are beer battered and so sadly they're not gluten-free). I asked if it would be possible to substitute a side of coleslaw for the bun due to not being able to eat it. The guy said sure and then proceeded to still charge me for a medium coleslaw. cool. Then, I also ordered the collard greens. I took the food back to our table and started eating it. My colleagues noticed instantly that I was merely picking at my food and they pointed out that I had gotten a terrible cut of the pork. I had essentially received a bowl of chewy pork fat. That is not an exaggeration, it was a full bowl of chewy pork fat with potentially 2 edible bites in the whole portion. I am being 100% serious when I say I would not have fed my dog this pulled pork. In all my years eating pulled pork I've never seen anything like this. Because I have never sent food back/complained to a vendor about their food, I was not inclined at all to go back to the truck. My colleagues pressured me and reiterated how not okay my meal was and one even offered to come with me so I took a deep breath and went back to the truck. I showed the guy at the window my bowl of uneaten pork fat and he proceeded to not even make eye contact and tell me ""that's just how it is. that's just how pork shoulder is"". I was speechless for a second and then followed up with ""this is not how pork is. I've both prepared and eaten pulled pork countless times and I have never seen anything like this in my life"". He repeated ""yeah, that's how it is. That's just pork"" Mind you there were around 7 people standing off to the side waiting for their food and watching this whole thing go down absolutely mortified with me. My friend was also there and suddenly I was really grateful to have someone who witnessed this because I seriously don't know if my colleagues would have believed just how horrible, rude, snobby, and disrespectful this whole interaction was if she hadn't seen it too. Seeing that this interaction would clearly not be going anywhere, I simply turned around and showed everyone my ""pulled pork"" and told them that I hoped none of them ordered it because they were in for a bad surprise. The people in line were speechless too. The staff didn't so much as offer to exchange my uneaten bowl of pork fat for at least another portion and certainly nothing about my money back. 13$ for a disgusting inedible meal, Ray Ray's should be ashamed. I will be telling all of my friends to never ever eat at Ray Rays.","

Being a small, narrow Italian restaurant, there is very limited seating. After waiting outside for over 15 minutes past reservation time for our table to be available, we were escorted to the back kitchen hallway to wait. Standing there for an additional 15 minutes, the General Manager offered wine ""while we wait"" and hovered over us with a menu until we ordered. We were then seated at the bar to continue waiting for an additional 15 minutes. Mind you, the reservations have a clear ""end time"" and the table we were supposed to be sitting at was still casually making their way through a bottle on wine. After 45 MINUTES of waiting, we were seated and enjoyed a $400+ total meal between the 4 of us.When the bill arrived, the first glasses of wine were included on the bill. When questioned, the General Manager was argumentative and unpleasant claiming she never intended the drinks to be comped.

We don't mind paying a lot for excellent food in adequate quantities. And, it is a little uncomfortable to write a negative review.Our family/friends who dine out A LOT heard about this restaurant so we decided to give it a go since we all love Italian food. We were baited due to the on line descriptions of freshly made home made pasta although I personally was a little put off by the very limited menu and a only fixed price options (3 courses for $45 or 4 courses for $60). Also, since the place is open only 4 nights a week it gives off an aura of being something special/exclusive so we were intrigued.We came on a Friday evening at 5 and it wasn't very busy. Our waitress said that she was part of the owner's family and she explained the dishes. We ordered drinks/wine. For an unknown reason one of the drinks didn't materialize after about 20 min so we asked for it again and it took another 10 min for it to arrive. (I am convinced that if we didn't ask the second time it would never come). I could go on in painful detail about how disastrous the courses were but I will summarize briefly: I haven't had this bad and expensive meal as far as I can remember. The portions were minuscule; the pasta was WAAAAY underdone (3 levels below al dente), and none of it was beyond lukewarm. One of the dishes (was described as ""with house made sausage"") had literally microscopic sausage bits ....and you had to actually hunt for those - none were obvious. The panzanella salad was minute, the lemoncello cake had a decent flavor but was very dry....I could go on and on. It also took very long between courses. The waitress did bring us fresh focaccia (very good, BTW) at the start of the dinner but, unbeknownst to us, we were charged for it in the end. The best part of the meal was the wine - how sad! Needless to say, we are NEVER going back and will discourage/warn anyone who wants to go.","

There were other Cameron Mitchell locations that have posted about their employees testing positive and shutting down, however they claim they immediately made the decision to shut down out of concern for their employees and guests. If this were true, wouldn't they be closing any location after having a positive case and shutting each down for at LEAST two weeks?

The inconsistency with their food, service, and drinks definitely leaves you wanting/needing more, the food is good/mediocre when Chef Ashley is working, but not any of the other cooks/chefs. They have 3 solid servers in the whole restaurant, 2 decent hosts, and absolutely terrible bartenders with the worse attitudes. Overall, poor service for the price point. I've even noticed my bowel movements smell worse after eating their food regularly, that only happens when I eat at crappy establishments like Condados, or Winking Lizard, or fast food for that matter. They say urban fusion, but in reality its Midwest b.s. packaged and presented in a sometimes ""pretty"" way, although they do serve ""brunch"" all day which was one of their selling points. Their desserts are ok, the bearded bakers cheesecakes are to die for, when offered, which they rarely are. I've spoken with some of the kitchen staff while dining in. I think it was one of the dishwashers who informed me they prep food sometimes, in the dishpit area . He specifically told me don't eat their bacon, shrimp, or wing dishes because of this. As recently as 10/3/21 I saw on a review on their FB page that a guest had gotten sick because of the wings she ate, amongst other issues she had during her dining experience, and the GM did nothing to fix it. Which is par for course based on what I've seen from the guy. One of their hosts has no idea what she is doing, and it shows. She's the tall blond lady. My fiancés reservations are always being messed up or handled incorrectly. The assistant GM has such a terrible attitude that you can see when she's there all the employees seem to get very agitated. The GM is very passive aggressive and fake towards guests, as I've already alluded to earlier. On several occasions I've overheard both him and his assistant GM talk crap about customers to their staff, as if the whole restaurant didn't hear them. I used to like the menu, but it's honestly overpriced for what they serve especially when you consider its only really good 3/10 times and it makes going to the bathroom even less pleasant than before. The new manager they brought on is lovely and we've truly enjoyed his presence when we dine in, but during our last few outtings there, he, plus the drinks HE recommended, and the ambience of the restaurant were the only decent parts of the evening. As the rest of the staff, food, and overall vibe was off. He had to comp most of our order as it was made incorrectly or just didn't taste or look good. He tried to make it better, I'll give him that. You could tell he cared. I think the issue they are having is because they are trying to be something they are not. A lot of their customers honestly don't fit within the vibe the owners seem to be trying to create. Again, they say urban, but I don't think they mean it. It's a terrible location, although it does have a rooftop, which I only recently found out about after having been going to that restaurant for nearly 3 months. It seems to be terribly mismanaged. Tbh if I were to recommend a restaurant with a waaay better location, more pleasant vibes, and an overall better menu, I'd check out Del Mar in the Short North. Their service is always on point, they have a more knowledgeable staff, and waaay friendlier management. Plus the quality of their food, drinks and service match what you pay for there, rather than probably getting ripped off by going to The Woodbury or possibly mugged outside. The Woodbury is essentially next to one of downtowns worse off hotels which is right down the street from the Greyhound bus station, that has swarms of vagrants throughout the sidewalks and parking lots in and around the surrounding area. Not as much of a problem in the Short North... I've noticed they treat customers differently based off of their previeved socioeconomic backgrounds. I thought it was just my imagination, but after the last few instances my fiancé and I were in there I bought it to her attention and she agrees. The table of politicians/finance/business-men and woman seemingly gets better treatment than the group of young black kids enjoying a birthday celebration... Just some food for thought. Mind you these are just my opinions, based off of MY experiences. Take it with a grain of salt, but like I said in the beginning, we will most likely never return. My fiancé and I have given them plenty of chances, but they seem to always drop the ball. We only went as many times as we did, because we live within walking distance. No more, trips to the Short North or German village seem more viable as there really isn't any good downtown restaurants.","

Naturally, I didn't touch the drink. Sabrina kindly brought me ginger ale and crackers instead. After sitting with my party of 6 fabulous Black Queens long enough for the ice to melt in my untouched drink, Sabrina offered to remove it. Moments later, Austin arrives at our table and initiated a highly aggressive exchange. He challenged the reason that the drink was returned, although acknowledging that he hadn't been touched. We explained that the wings made me sick and that the drink had been forgotten in my attempts to settle my stomach. Austin's response was, ""other people like the wings "". What's the relevance of other people liking wings that caused me to vomit , Austin?After emphasizing that I was still too nauseous to drink the alcoholic beverage, Austin's next reply was, ""you don't go buy a car and just return it because you don't want it anymore. Same thing with the drink.""Naturally, the conversation devolved further, with Austin saying he'd take care of it, but not actually doing anything. He still charged me for the untouched drink. We asked for Austin's boss, and Molly (Austin's assistant) brought us AUSTIN's business card. She said that Austin was as high as it goes. Really Molly?

It wasn't bad and it wasn't great. The Hello Kitty roll was not good, but a kiddo ordered it (surprised?) The Spider Roll had me wondering, since it had no crab legs visible, just exactly what had been rolled up inside it. I'm just used to seeing fried legs sticking out, and you know you're dealing with a whole softshell crab. It tasted fine though. None of it, however, was worth the wait. To be fair, I have yet to taste food in Columbus that IS worth waiting 1.5hrs for, and if I hadn't been with family, I wouldn't have stuck around this place that long either. My point is that the food here isn't the problem - the service IS. Making matters worse was how many take-out orders they paraded past us while we sat in front of them looking like sad, abandoned kittens, with never a mention of when we might be served. When we finally asked, after over an hour, we were told 'not much longer, maybe 5 minutes. sorry' and the server began to walk away. I replied 'Not as sorry as I am'. This seemed to trigger this small person, who turned with a retort 'What did you say to me?' So I repeated, ""I said - You're not as sorry as I am"". We engaged in a short argument about whether our wait had been too long (apparently not, and we should expect to wait this long!) When I said ""This is ridiculous!"" to which he replied ""What did you call me?!?"" Well, I don't know what this person heard, or what sort of life experiences causes them to continually seek oppression that is not being dealt to them, but good grief. When you make people wait that long, you better be prepared for unhappy customers, and if it gives you PTSD when a customer rightfully complains, you're in the wrong line of work. I'm inclined to think our server wasn't the only person associated with this place that is in the wrong line of work. sayonara 1126","

When we asked about a sauce that we could get on the side and the chef laughed at us and said it was impossible because it was rare for customers to ask for it.

When we sat down we told our waitress that my wife has celiac disease and can't have any gluten. When we were brought out our first sushi rolls we noticed that one of them probably had tempura flakes (gluten). We brought it to the attention of our server, she agreed, apologized and went to get it replaced. The replacement roll was brought out, my wife took a bite, and sure enough, it also had tempura. We missed it this time. This is a big deal and isn't just a food allergy. I told our waitress and she apologized again and got us another roll replacement. Soon after my wife started to feel sick and wanted to leave. When we were brought the bill we were fully charged (they didn't even remove the one roll that they had to replace twice). I told the waitress I didn't think it was acceptable to pay full price for this because now my wife is sick. She went and spoke to the manager again and they agreed to remove the one $10 roll that they messed up. I had made the mistake of giving my credit card to the waitress and she ran my card before she came back this time. I went and spoke with the manager who said she didn't realize what had happened but that there was nothing she could do. My wife was already sitting in the car so I just left. I contacted the restaurant after the fact to try and complain to the owner but I received no response at all. I'm really disappointed because the food was otherwise really good and we would have come back here over and over. I feel like my only recourse now is a negative review.

Mac and cheese was mediocre but alright. Now for the important barbecue review:Pulled pork: okay- not dry but tasted the best with their green sauce (had some pineapple in it?? Don't remember the name) Brisket: wish I had gotten more than a couple slices on the board! But, I probably enjoyed it the most. Very tender as a brisket should be but needed more flavor on the rub!!Chicken: very crispy skin which was great. Somewhat dry but paired well with the garlic aioli sauceSausage: fairly average but was good with peach habenero sauce was alright Ribs: not very good. Dry and hard to get off the bone. No flavor on the ribs themselves :(TL;DR: Overall, I feel like it's very much good barbecue made for Ohioans (I feel that food in Ohio doesn't have much flavor in general), but as someone from Texas who believes that food on its own should have flavor and doesn't absolutely need to be drenched in a sauce, it was average. If you go, get the brisket and Mac and cheese (maybe other sides are better?)","

The fried looked and tasted like they had sat in the basket all day long! they were not edible. ($4.50). The Cole slaw was just cabbage thrown in a container. (no dressing 3.50) and the mac and cheese (4.50) was also dry, nasty and cold). Management needs to fix this or no one will be coming back. also, the kitchen was a mess with food scraps everywhere.

The Cole slaw had no flavor other than the taste of shredded cabbage. I could taste a slight hint of something like vinegar but honestly it was so slight that I cannot say for certain that's what the flavor/sauce was supposed to be.

I was very specific with orders for two sandwiches and sides. Something said open and ck your order b4 leaving premises and thankfully I did. Two sides were missing and the toppings for one sandwich was wrong. I asked to speak with a manager and the chef came over handing me a corrected topping container. He offered no apology--I stated had I not stopped to view my order I would have been home with an incomplete order... Response, ""Yes I'm sorry."" No offer to compensate in any way. This is the inconsistent business practice. When NorthStar do you offer to have the 'next one on us'? I spoke to another manager--female I have interacted with over the years, though I am certain she did not recognize me. It should not matter--I shared my frustration and the chef's cavalier attitude which really angered me. As I'm leaving she offers the cards--too late... Why was that not the chef's first offer--when he came up to me he had been told a topping was incorrect and two sides were not with my order??

The croque madame my boyfriend got was small and mediocre and my winter vegetable salad was drenched in dressing. For desert our friends ordered a banana's foster. No one brought it in time so our server gave us a melted lukewarm bananas foster and said it was being remade. The weird thing is that when the new one came out, it looked like it wasn't even made using the same ingredients. The two had completely different colors and not because the first was already a soup by the time it was at our table. Then, I paid with cash giving our server $60 for a $50 check and she had the audacity to give me a $10 dollar bill back, no $5s or $1s, just a $10 like that service deserved a 20% tip.

We dined as a group of 9 girlfriends at Lindey's last night, no special occasion, just trying to have a good time. We usually go out once a month, try Columbus' good restaurants. As you can see from my rating, we did not have a good experience. In fact, it may be my worst experience at an upscale restaurant, totally unexpected. Our reservation was originally for 12 at 6 pm, one got sick, two canceled at the last minute. The table was setup for 12 but could actually only fit 10 comfortably. Anyways, I was the one first to arrive, at 5:59 pm. Then, within 10-15 min we were 6 at the table. During that time, our waitress took our drink orders. But we were quite hungry actually and told her that some of us are ready to order. She kept coming back and forth to the table, however not taking any orders. When she was again by our table, I told her that the Riesling I ordered was actually not sweet but a dry one. Because I specifically asked for a sweet one and ended up getting a dry one. I am into sweet, balanced tasting Riesling's these days and I thought an upscale place like Lindey's could have a good one. Well, she told me that my Riesling was actually sweet (well, literally acting like my taste buds) and totally disregarded my comment. But what she suggested after that is a complete indication of her unprofessionalism: She suggested that ""I take a sip from my friend's Cava sparkling wine, maybe that could be sweet for me?"" Excuse me?!!! If you want me to try another wine, you should offer a freaking sample!!!!! I don't have to sip from anybody else's drink. But, I did not make a big deal, and actually, stupidly, tried my friend's wine and decided to keep my original Riesling.A few minutes later, a man approached our table stating that our table was reserved for 6 pm, and we have to order soon, and have to be out of there at 8 pm, because the table was reserved for 8 pm, with a very rude attitude. What???? I mean seriously, how can you tell your customers when it will be the time to leave your restaurant? I will be paying $28 for a grouper and I can stay as long as I want, if I choose to (not that I was going to).... I think we should have left the restaurant at that point, but our evening was getting ruined and we were hungry, so we went ahead and ordered. The mean attitude continued, we told our waitress that we were very unhappy with that man's comments, whom we had to guess was the manager, because he did not bother to introduce himself, or greet us. The meals came out in a record 10-12 min. One would be normally very impressed but we knew that happened because they wanted us to leave the restaurant asap. Our fun was gone, and all we talked about was how rude we were treated and what we should do. I then called another restaurant and made a reservation just for coffee and desserts. On our way out, I stopped by the hostess area, and approached ""the other manager"". I told him in a very calm and polite way how we were treated, still expecting some normal reaction. I also added that I was sincerely hoping that this all did not happen because we had an accent and spoke another language at the table, among ourselves. He said that he highly doubted that, but I totally had the impression that Lindey's is a place that preferably serves white, middle-aged, rich people who are native speakers. The reason I think that is because I cannot find any legitimate reason for their rude attitude toward us. We have not behaved in any inappropriate way, were not loud, or not dismissive of our waitress or rude to her. If we ended up not ordering on THEIR tight time-frame, that is because of the incompetency of their waitress, who clearly did not know how to handle a large group.While this conversation was going on with the other manager, the manager who approached our table came, and you cannot believe what he told me: How could we leave only $16 of tip to his waitress???? Well, we all decided to leave $2 each to send a message. Obviously, we even left too much... Arrogant and rude attitude continued and got a lot worse. I told him that it was my discretion, I could leave any amount of tip I wanted based on the service I received, and added that I had not seen such rudeness to customers in any other restaurant. He suggested that maybe Lindey's was not a restaurant for us, the only right comment he made all evening! We will never go back, or bring any of our business there... Their loss really. To comment on the food: sauces (remoulade and cocktail), aioli with fries, were really good. Grouper was so so, fish was tasting bland, however the creole cake underneath was really good, sauce around it was too sweet. My friend had a burger, she said that it was ok. Calamari and shrimp were also good. But, good food can be found at many other places, it is the service and attitude that makes a restaurant upscale, which Lindey's is definitely not...","

I ordered the duck and my husband ordered the lamb and the meat on both orders tasted terrible, as it was not seasoned, lacking in flavor and the sauce over the duck had a strong pungent vinegar taste. I asked the waiter who was the chef, he said John Carol. I asked if he was the one that cooked this food, he said: Oh no...When I get an eighty dollar bill for a terrible dinner with NO drinks that someone probably with no schooling cooked I'm a little upset to say the least. The only reason why we ate the food is that it was late in the evening and we had not eat all day, so you would think that anything would of tasted great, but no I had the thought of the taste in my mouth for two days! The French onion soup was just okay, as I had better and the tiramisu was good but different than the traditional tiramisu that is soaked on the bottom with liquor, which is how I prefer it.

Anticipating an Asian fusion spot that serves food until 2am sounded amazing especially there's literally no good food past 9pm downtown. But from the food, the prices, the portions, not having a server and the atmosphere the whole experience is kind of a let down. The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming so nothing bad to say there. some dishes like the cacio pepe, katsu sandwich, popcorn chicken and some of the skewers are really good. the rest is just meh and overpriced with a shittt portion. i traditionally love ordering food, to sit down, eat and then leave. But only thing here is that if you need more water, another drink, to ask a question you gotta get your ass up and walk to the bar when you're trying to eat. personally it makes the right space feel chaotic and not a great atmosphere to have a meal. then the patrons are the worst part. Millennials trying extra hard to be cool and make the place feel like it's exclusive with an extra dose of snobbish BS. feels routine for most new restaurants that open in Columbus where all the ""cool kids"" kinda ruin the place for the rest of us. and thats all I got for now. overall its fine but just okay.","

There is a valet for the Hilton across the street. A few cars parked next to the restaurant, but theres a sign that says ""no parking"".The atmosphere was amazing, hands down 10/10. There was beautiful art everywhere,clean bathrooms and tables. The staff and my server were nice also. I got the House Carne Asada Egg Roll and it was disappointing honestly. The outside had a beautiful golden crust and the inside had a decent flavor combination, but the meat was very bland 5.3/10 . Now, that SAUCE that was served with it is a 10/10. Its the perfect combination of spicy and sweet, but has a helluva kick (which i LOVE) without trying to burn your tastebuds. The Elote was pretty good 8/10. I was excited for Jedi, but was met with the same problem as the egg-roll with bland chicken, so the whole taco relies on all other ingredients 6.6/10. Fish tacos 6/10, i did like the strawberry salsa, but it is very overpowering on the taco and covered the unseasoned fish taste. Lastly, the Birria Burrito 7/10. Really good cheese and rice, but the worst consume I've ever had, tasted like warm broth and fat 0/10 do not recommend the broth. If they did a better job with meat preparation or got a Southern Cali cook back there,all of those dishes would have easily been . Im sure the restaurants in other locations are probably amazing, and maybe today was just a bad day for the cook, but for the price point and portion size, its not worth it.Highly recommend this place for a drink with friends, but as a restaurant, its pretty mid.

I have worked in customer service almost the entire time I have been legally able to have a job. I have never disrespected a customer in front of other customers. Never. Seriously, never. The worker was blonde with a slight wave in her hair. She was very irate and frustrated with vulnerable woman. I understand being frustrated. I do. But I would never talk down about another customer in front of other customers. I was very offended for this woman. The man at the bar and others never said anything disrespectful in front of us, but the blonde did. In a very OBVIOUS way. Literally looked at this poor girl(that had obviously been abused and going through such a hard time) and PUBLICLY shamed her. Saying ""YEAH. SHE'S back. And needs to leave."" Kept saying that. I wish I had gotten this workers name. (Guy at the bar working with this girl was so nice to the woman going through hard times. I really appreciated that).This girl wasn't causing disruption. It was very inappropriate for this worker to say anything about this costumer. Especially in front of customers. Quiet frankly, I am very offended for this women. I cannot understand ---at all--understand how this worker--thought it was okay to laugh and basically, insult this customer. I am livid writing this reviews. Food was GREAT. Service at bar seemed great. Except the blonde that kept talking to other employees about this customer; when they didn't even respond to her.I just thought this might be useful information to someone. I don't typically make these kind of reviews, but in this situation, I thought it was necessary.Long story short: yeah. People have bad days. Some more than others.

If you want a hospital cafeteria quality meal with Wal-mart ingredients and 6 dollar beers then this is the restaurant for you. Aside from the dingy atmosphere and terrible seating arrangement, they blasted overplayed pop music to the point where you literally could not have a conversation with the person sitting across from you. I could almost understand this if it was a busy weekend but we arrived at 4pm on a Thursday.After being asked twice in a 5 minute period if we were ready to order, our server disappears. A grouchy lady then comes to our table, without introducing herself, and barks, ""what do you want"" while intensely staring at her notepad. We ordered two burgers and an appetizer of ""burrito bites"". The appetizer arrived in the form of 6 Mcdonald's chicken nuggets sitting atop a pile of Subway lettuce accompanied by styrofoam side plates. The filling resembled microwaveable burrito sauce, lacking meat, real cheese and flavor. We struggled this off, figuring it was typical bar appetizers and the burgers would we the real winners. We were absolutely wrong. The burgers were gigantic hunks of dry meat with yellow, mass produced, pre packaged buns and lifeless produce. The bacon on my burger tasted like greasy beef jerky that was difficult to even tear apart. After eating half of our burgers we knew we made the wrong decision as we started feeling nauseous.All of these reviews hype the burgers up so much but it is completely unjustified. Quantity is not better than quality, and Thurman's is a perfect example of this. I have trouble even calling what they serve food. I wish I could give this place negative stars.","

It should have been freshly cut lettuce with freshly made dressing and it was neither of those things. It looked and tasted like it came out of a salad kit bag that was on manager's special at the grocery store. It had clearly been sitting around for awhile before it made it to my plate. I only ate a few bites of it. It is a shame that a restaurant that prides itself on high-quality food would serve this to their customers. The main courses were not much better. The lamb was under cooked and the salmon and scallops were over cooked and over seasoned. We paid for an extravagant meal and received food that was one step up from Max and Erma's.

I'm old school and something always goes wrong every time I try to order food online and this time didn't fail to go wrong as usual. I order from the Gahanna location every Tuesday after my therapy appointment. I usually just go over and order in person and wait for my order to be ready. Today I decided to try online ordering. I was unaware Gahanna location and the downtown location are both on High Street. So I didn't realize when I went to the website from the Gahanna location's Google maps and saw High Street I thought it was the location I was looking for. But it was not, when I went to pick my order it was not there. Neither location would honor my order. The downtown location would not give me a refund and the Gahanna location would not give me my order unless I paid for it again. This is very bad customer service. The quality of a product is important but what is most important to me is customer service. I eat here on a weekly basis and I feel disrespected that they would not honor my request to have my order transferred. So they just have my money and I have no food. I really liked this place but I'm going to have to stop giving them my money for a few months until they make it right or until I'm no longer upset.","

Neither of the bartenders relayed this information. Instead of checking to see if my first bottle was empty, the female bartender threw the bottle of wine away. The bottle indeed had 2 pours of wine left. Which we later found out, after asking the bartender to grab the bottle out of the trash. Instead she poured us an extra glass of wine. Which was nice, but our group would have appreciated more if she had acknowledged her wrong doing and apologized instead of walking away. They also did not serve us the wine I ordered, instead it was a wine of the same price point and region, but did not tell us they were out of the wine we had ordered.

We clearly stated who we were, our objective and we were told we would be accommodated. We also made sure that when we took these photographs not to include any Patrons and or specific RH brand logos. I have been in photography for quite sometime and I have never been harassed for simply having a camera. We had a party comprised of 9 beautiful African American young and professional women. While we were dining we were snapping photos of our group with our Cellphones and Cameras. We were approached by a female manger who stated we were not allowed to take any professional pictures INSIDE the restaurant. We were left feeling very confused, again completely embarrassed and feeling singled out as we specifically reached out to restaurant management prior to making a reservation to ensure there were no issues with our parties intentions. Had we been informed 2 weeks prior we would have definitely secured a new location and spent our money elsewhere. Because of the decor and ambiance within this establishment there were patrons taking group photos inside the restaurant. Those same patrons were taking photos that resulted in other patrons having to wait or move out of the way etc. Yet to my knowledge no other customers were approached as we were. After we finished dining we were never once approached by management for positive interaction including not being asked how was our meal etc. We honestly felt ostracized for doing something 90% of what patrons were doing using their cell phones. We did approach the Male manger who had previously cleared our party's intentions and he again assured us there were no issues. Instead of continuing to photograph inside the restaurant we opted to go outside the Restaurant onto the rooftop patio which was virtually empty due to the cold weather in Ohio and snapped some pics of the skyline with our party. We were again approached by the same female manager and several waitstaff now stating it was against company policy to take professional photos outside? Even though originally we were told we could not take pictures INSIDE of the restaurant. We tried to explain that we had just spoken to someone in management who cleared our party to do so. Rather than consult with her management team she basically ushered us out of the restaurant. So this was yet another negative interaction due to a clear miscommunication amongst leadership/management. Her behavior demeanor, and tone in layman's terms basically called us liars this was in full view of other patrons inside the restaurant. After this interaction I made sure to ask management for the corporate contact information before we left, in order to make you aware of the treatment we received from your management staff. The biggest issue I would like drive home is we were customers/patrons yet we were made to feel and look as if we were trespassing. Furthermore we were not approached prior to ordering our food and drinks stating there was any specific photography policy. We did not hide our cameras at any point so they were in plain view of management and staff from the time we arrived. There is no mention of this on any website nor were there any signs posted within the establishment forbidding professional photography. This interaction was highly disturbing and I will be posting on my social media to shine a light on how we as black women and black consumers are treated in real world every day social interactions. There is always a better way to handle these types of situations and the management team and staff at RH definitely missed the mark.","

Surprisingly we were paged about 6:30 for our table. Lovely, friendly hostess showed us to our table. Scanned the menu and discovered it was very limited in selection and pricey. Asked our server if the heat could be turned up as it was chilly where we were seated. Didn't change. No liquor license. BooHoo! Wine is expensive for a modest serving. We ordered 3 RH burgers and 1salmon entree. We expected nice plump, juicy patties and got 2 well done thin patties that were almost impossible to cut with a steak knife. Mc Donald's is much better! The salmon entree was presented on a dinner plate with no garnish or anything else. It looked pitiful! While the setting is lovely,they have a long way to go with their menu and quality of the food.

The ambiance was great, but we went to RH Rooftop for our anniversary dinner at 8:45pm with reservations and didn't get seated until about 9:40pm. The food was forgettable, we tried the Prime Rib sandwich (was ok with the dipping sauce), Caesar salad (could have been better), artichoke appetizer (which was the only good thing that I'd recommend), the Burrata which sounded better on the menu then it actually was, and the mushrooms (came out flavorless and dry). The salads and the artichoke appetizer which we thought was sent to make up for our long wait was set on our table by mistake. We saw the look on our waiters face with surprise and confusion ""like where did this come from."" Overall, I'd give the restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars.","

The furniture store is fabulous and very high end. The entrance, hospitality and walk up to the restaurant is great. We sat in a gorgeous dining room with the best chandeliers. We weren't allowed outside on the rooftop patio though. Covid and stuff. Mebu seemed super condensed and they only have wine and beer. No cocktails which seems odd. We thought it was a covud thing but the server said no. The hamburger was a hamburger and super heavy. We started with some kind of charcuterie board that had a great balsamic vinegar but there was so little of it. We asked for more and got a dollup with the announcement that its really expensive. The salmon was cooked great and yummy bit its literally just a piece if salmon. We ordered sides like fried and veggies. If not, there wouldn't have been enough food. The shaved rib sandwich seemed to be the best meal. Service was boring and for 300 for the meal for 4, we left hungry and feeling incomplete.","

Feb 16as we reached we were seated promptly in nice booth pretty close to door.1 They need to protect the entrance by a double door so that when guests are entering or leaving a cold draft should not be felt by diners.2 It took 15 to 20 minutes for our server to come bring menus, but its ok3 Does this Restaurant know about SANITIZATION . My water glass has greasy finger prints and deep Red lipstick marks. so brought to servers attention, to which she Said OH let me get you another glass. Surprising no remorse (1st time). then i noticed that there was a busser cleaning tables with green color rag. TO my surprise he kept wiping tables with same rag so our table must been cleaned in the same way. On top of it our silver ware was also on the bare table. No imagine where that green rag has been before.4 If this restaurant like bare tables then they need to wrap the silver ware in linen napkins then place them on tables. For the price point i will expect starched table cloth service.5 we all ordered our drinks and appetizers.I asked for Jhony walker black staright up, my wife ordered kavaha and 2 non-alcoholic drinks for table.Appetizers :  We ordered 1 Keema , 2 paneer rolls chicken malai tikka green peas kulchai asked our server about the portion sizes as we all 5 have to share, she said the its enough but NO its not.6 Our first appetizer arrived quick in less then 5 minutes was a little bowl about 4oz of keema with one small piece of butter toast. second paneer roll about 6 minutes later about 5 to 6 inch roll cut into 3 pieces and over cooked. lastly chicken malai tikka in a bowl, that was kept and cooked in a convection oven like all other appetizers. Its not malai tikka from Tandoor.( So be aware)6 Service??? we all were almost done with appetizers when we got our drinks. (2nd Time)7 FOOD ::: we ordered paneer pinwheel, butter chicken 2 garlic naans and a chili cheese naan and lost grain and veg pulao . AGAIN asked server if the portion size so we can order enough to which she said there are large plates and will be enough. Our chili cheese kulcha was brought to us in about 4 minutes and left on table and we all have to wait about another 15 minutes for rest of food by then our CHILI CHEESE PITA was cold,Finally we got our food and we were missing LOST grain Pulao. so we flagged our server and asked her (3rd Time) to which she herself have to go and get it. Butter chicken (22 oz serving bowl with 4 small chunks of chicken and little sauce not even enough for 2) same goes with Paneer pinwheel. Garlic bread has no garlic. Chili cheese naan had no chili but was sprinkled with red chili powder. Food was cold and rest of the job was done by the cold draft we keep getting every few minutes from the front door.We saw the same disappointment on table next us as their items were also forgotten and reminded regularly to same server we had.7 So asked another Jhony walker black (Straight UP) but was brought to me chilled and watered down and on top of it our server picked up my other glass and dumped all the contents into my new drink laughing and saying OH YOU HAVE SOME DROPS LEFT, I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS ANY WHERE. SERVER CAN ASK TO REMOVE MY GLASS IF I SAY YES BUT SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO DUMP REMAINS OF AN OLD GLASS TO MY NEW DRINK (4th Time)8 She was gone for about 10 minute and by thhis time all tables around also left, i flagged her and asked that i wanted my drink straight up and the i got was very chilled and water downed. To this she took me drink back and returned with a correct drink but in champagne Flute looking long stem glass.Being a scotch drinker for 38 years if a bartender or a server dont know how to serve a drink and to chose a correct glass its a SHAME.I hope THE RESTAURANT OWNERS AND MANAGER CAN BE MORE ATTENTIVE AND SEE HOW BARTENDERS AND SERVERS ARE PERFORMING AS IT ALL REFLECTS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AND ITS FUTURE.ALL THE BEST AND WE SAW A TALL SKINNY GENTLEMAN WALKING AROUND IN BLACK JACKET AND PANTS AND HE HAPPENS TO BE THE MANAGER HE SHOULD TALK ALL TABLES AND FIND OUT HOW IS EVERY THING AND TRY TO CORRECT BEFORE GUESTS LEAVE. THIS WILL HELP WITH GOD REVIEWS AND SAVE THEM LOT OF TIME APOLOGIZING TO REVIEWS.","

Not enough servers or bartenders for a Sunday Night on opening week. Tons of empty tables yet they claimed there was a wait for table, clear indication of being understaffed.the ticket times are ridiculously long. The naan took 40 minutes to get to us after ordering.An hour after we sat at the bar and already closed out our tab, the owner/manager got very violent with us. He asked us to leave because we criticized the service of the establishment. He physically pushed us out of the restaurant and called the police. Obviously the police just laughed him off, but I would not recommend this place, as if you have a genuine service complaint, they will physically push you out of the restaurant. This is not the way to run a business, especially one that is new to Columbus. The ownership and manager has no manners and has no concept of customer service, it is clear that he has no experience on the service industry as he physically put hands on customers, if I were to be seriously injured, his insurance policy would most likely not cover him for it. Shout out to Spencer though , he's a great bartender. Way too good to work for these amateur sindhi restauranteurs.I have video of the owner physically assaulting me and slamming the door on my hand, I am sending it to local news and journalist outlets. This place can be good.I feel bad for staff as they have to feel the burden of poor ownership.","

I am a regular at Bristol and until this morning, I would have never thought of writing such a review. Happy hour? Great. Nightlife? Wonderful. BBQ? Delightful. However, Brunch??? You will not catch me wasting my Sunday morning in this fashion ever again. Upon arrival, I was seated to a small table with my friends amidst bustling servers and fretted food runners. I was greeted about 10 minutes later reminding our table that it was a buffet. No water, no silverware, little service. We ventured to the buffet to find most of the food gone, unprepared, or simply unappealing. We then ate sub-par food for the steep price of 19.99 per head + tip. All in all, I do not necessarily blame the staff/service of the restaurant. This seems to me like a management issue. The faces of the servers were distraught, telling me they were simply unequipped with the right tools to do their jobs. Regardless, do not waste your time for brunch if you want the experience of a high school cafeteria at the price of a gourmet meal. Sincerely, A bristol frequenter","

We then waited for another 35 min before I had to flag down our server to ask about our nachos.

Let me begin by saying I am a lover of beans and hummus. I have never met a bean I didn't like, even red beans. However, something happened when this particular red bean hummus was made.It literally tasted like someone mixed together mashed up dog food and an ash tray. I have never before told a waiter that the food was so bad, I had to return it.Tonight, this happened. Maybe carnivores will enjoy the food here, but any vegan/vegetarian should stay far, far away.

Then, two minutes into our appitezer, our main course comes out. So we push the fries to the side and start eating. My mac and cheese was okay, but by no means as good as the reviews made it sound like it would be. The cheese was bland. But the real kicker was my man's entree. The meatloaf was good, and the mashed potatoes, but as I looked at him I saw a strange expression pass his face when he went for the green beans. He looked at me, and told me to take a bite. I did so with hesitation, and rightfully so, as I have never tasted anything so foul in my entire life. I have no idea what was wrong with these things, they tasted as if they were six months past freshness and steeped in bleach. I am not kidding. This was not food, this was something that nature never intended to exist. We told the waitress, and she looked at us as if we were crazy, but brought out some more mashed potatoes instead. I'm still in awe of those beans, I have no idea how they possibly could have been so foul. I'm sure it was a fluke, but still, I cannot put into words how terrible and strange they tasted.

The hostess seated us at a dirty table and had the bus boy wipe our table with a little napkin where he pushed all the dirty food off the table and into the seat and floor. We decided to stay anyway, even after five minutes without anyone coming to our table. We order the pork belly bao and that came out wrong. We modified our ramen to include extra bean sprouts for one and the other one no mushroom and pickled ginger. It took more than 30 minutes for our food to come out only for it to be completely wrong--the one with extra bean sprouts had no veggies, and the other one, had everything we asked not to have. Getting the waiter's attention was difficult because we couldn't even get our drinks refilled. After 15 minutes, we finally got ahold of him where he offered to remake it. Note that we barely touched our ramen. A man, which I assumed was the manager, came up to ask what I ordered and walked away with no apologies whatsoever. It took ANOTHER 25 minutes and our food did not come out even though it was their mess up (you would think they'd get it out ASAP)--so we asked for the check and for the food to be packed up. They charged an additional fee for extra beansprouts and we weren't expecting a discount but they charged for extra beansprouts that we didn't get?? Not to mention, we haven't even received our remake yet! We ended up leaving after the waiter had told us for the second time that our food will be out soon. We got up to leave when he told us the food was ready and was MADE FOR HERE. We saw them dump the ramen into a to go bowl...and needless to say, that was the last straw. SERIOUSLY? How are they operating?? To make matters worse, NO APOLOGIES?!? We will not return and we will definitely inform all of friends and family of such a terrible experience.","

Though I wasn't aware that it was primarily a burger joint, I decided to keep an open mind, considering my extensive burger experiences throughout the years. The Rail had been recommended to my friend, who had recently moved to the city, and I was curious to see what the fuss was all about.Upon arrival, I was greeted by a casual yet inviting atmosphere. The restaurant struck a perfect balance between being laid-back enough for a casual hangout with friends and classy enough for a potential date night. The dim lighting and cozy booths created an ambiance that felt comfortable and welcoming.As I perused the menu, I discovered that The Rail takes great pride in using Ohio beef and bacon. I must admit, I initially questioned what could possibly make these local ingredients so extraordinary. However, my skepticism quickly dissipated when I took my first bite of The Rail-avore burger.Now, I'm not usually a fan of mushrooms, but the combination of flavors in this burger intrigued me. The patty was perfectly cooked, juicy, and packed with robust beefy goodness. The bacon added a smoky and savory touch, complementing the meat wonderfully. Surprisingly, the sautéed mushrooms brought an earthy and rich element to the burger, balancing the flavors remarkably well.Perhaps it was hunger influencing my taste buds, or perhaps The Rail's culinary expertise truly shines through. Either way, the burger left an indelible impression on me. Despite my initial skepticism, I found myself genuinely enjoying every bite of The Rail-avore. The blend of Ohio beef, bacon, and mushrooms transformed what could have been an ordinary burger into a delightful surprise.Considering my positive experience, I can confidently say that I would return to The Rail to explore their other burger offerings. With a menu that boasts a variety of mouthwatering options, I'm eager to indulge in their creative combinations and see if they live up to the standard set by The Rail-avore.Aside from the delectable food, The Rail's inviting atmosphere played a crucial role in my overall experience. Whether you're looking for a laid-back outing with friends or a more intimate setting for a date, the restaurant provides a solid backdrop for both occasions. Its casual yet sophisticated vibe sets the stage for a memorable dining experience.In conclusion, The Rail is a burger joint that manages to surprise and delight, even for those who may be skeptical at first. With their exceptional use of local ingredients and creative burger combinations, they prove that Ohio beef and bacon can indeed be something special. Combined with the cozy atmosphere that effortlessly transitions between casual and romantic, The Rail offers an experience that's worth revisiting.","

I have witnessed Lola herself licking icing off of her fingers and then preparing a salad with her hands. YES!! She licked her fingers, then used her bare, licked fingers to dig into the lettuce and make a salad for a customer! I have witnessed Lola with bleeding sores on her body as well. Not the most hygienic! Another concern I have is the treatment of the staff. The atmosphere is ruined as soon as Lola begins to speak to her serving staff. It makes dining uncomfortable when your waitress is almost in tears because her boss has just chewed her out in front of the dining room. I will not eat there again because I value cleanliness and a staff that is treated well.","

We did, however, get to enjoy the absolute beauty of the upstairs bar.I will do a seperate review for the restaurant when I actually plan ahead and make reservations but let me tell you about the upstairs bar....Oh. My. God. First of all, the space itself is magnificent. There is nothing like it in all of Columbus and there probably isn't anything like it in the entire Midwest. High ceilings, glossy, marble (?) flooring, seperate lounge seating accompanied by flush rugs, chess, checker and billiard tables and an entire attitude very reminiscent of the 1920's. Ok, so great atmosphere. Better drinks. The three guys behind the bar are magicians. The crowd on Friday was reasonably busy, and as I opened the menu I was pretty surprised at how extensive their cocktail list was. Our server (forget his name, but he was lovely) explained to us the details of several different cocktails and even offered up some history behind some of the classic drinks. I (think) we ended up ordering the red Hook, bobby Burns, surfer girl and Beach Bum. They make a mean, mean Bobby Burns. And I say that as someone who has drank many of them at many bigger cities. The presentation is reasonably impressive (don't go there thinking you're going to get a fire show) due to the space, but you can tell those dudes care about what they are doing. It does give off a very ""rock n' roll"" atmosphere. The space is very swanky and the music was very ""indie chic."" It fit though. Try drinking a Bobby Burns chilled with liquid nitrogen while listening to the The Strokes. It's an experience you won't forget. The guys who run this bar are awesome, cordial, talented and my friends and I will be back there as soon as we can.","

Tucked away on a side street in the Short North (East Lincoln Street), this little gem of a restaurant offers a unique and sophisticated menu with selections that are complex and satisfying without being fussy or overly complicated. The interior of the restaurant is simply beautiful. The upper floor is open and light, and the lower floor is elegant and full of energy. We felt genuinely welcomed by the hostess and were immediately seated in an upper floor booth-chair section on the side opposite the beautiful bar area.The naan and spread appetizer was a great way to kick off our dinner. Both the babaganoush and hummus were classically prepared, but the whipped spicy feta was next level - perfectly smooth with a subtle kick at the end. Just enough to wake up the tastebuds before the star of the show - the whole fried fish arrived.I have to admit, I was a little nervous about the concept of having a whole fish set down in front of me, but our hostess and server explained how it was prepared and promised we would love it. They were right! The bass was exceptional - beautifully presented on a large plate along with tomato relish and greens, both of which complimented the fish perfectly. The fish was large enough for us to share and it came to the table already scored on both sides so all we had to do was pull off the pieces, scoop up some of the tomato relish and greens and enjoy! The fish was crispy and delicate at the same time. It was super fresh and flash fried to perfection, without being either dry or oily. If you go, seriously - get the whole fried fish. You won't regret it. We also had the Greek tomato salad as our side dish, and it was amazing. Lovely firm heirloom tomatoes with fresh herbs and the most unique whipped feta. Combined with the fish, I felt like we were dining somewhere on the coast and not in the Short North of Columbus. We finished our dinner with the sweet corn Brulee (remarkable!) and a chocolate mousse-type creation with beet molasses (decadent...and beet molasses! Who knew!), both of which were simply excellent and just enough to end the meal on a sweet note.The service was wonderful. Our server was attentive and charming. She recommended drink pairings and explained the dishes in detail without sounding hurried or condescending. One thing I noticed there (that I have never seen before) is that new cutlery is delivered as needed to the table in a beautiful leather box carried by the waitstaff. It's an interesting and fun detail among all the other fun-and-interesting details at Hiraeth: the pottery-type plates, the beautiful glassware, the colors, and the varied ceramic tiles throughout the restaurant. In case it's not obvious at this point, we had a fantastic dining experience at Hiraeth and look forward to a return visit. I hope they are successful in Columbus and if our experience was ""the norm"", I suspect they will be. Nicely done, Hiraeth Team!","

The service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. We all were planning on having drinks, apps and entrees if out server didn't disappear for 45 minutes after a drink order (that took an hour to receive). After trying to tell the female manager that we had been wanting to place an order and receive any type of service she refused to make eye contact and rolled her eyes saying ""sorry about that"". So we hunted down the server and just said we needed to close out (finally at least an hour later cashed out). If they didn't already add the 20% tip I do not believe that 1/18 of us would have left one. Worst service of my life, with no manager accommodation which is why I will never return or recommend this location to anyone.","

Definitely felt awkward to share, not nearly as fun. Our margarita glasses were tall and narrow, not fun to drink out of. Lastly, everything was unbelievably over-salted, like almost chokingly over-salted.The guacamole was too salty, the enchilada sauce was horrible, and the waiter basically just agreed with me.

I have now been to Lupo about a dozen times and the food never fails to amaze me. I love their creativity with tastes and the way the chefs manage to take something usually simple like chicken or lamb and wow me with some great flavors. Their menu changes so it's nice to be able to try something different with each visit. My favorite tapas are the Lamb Meatballs, The Sautéed Mussels, Duck leg Confit, Seared Scallops, and Chicken Liver Pate. I also love their Octopus when available. We have gone many of our friends who say they have great oysters so give those a try. The ""Large Format"" menu items are just as amazing. I personally love them all. Yes, I have tried all of it!  The Roasted Chicken is very moist, not dry with great flavors!  The Pork Shank and Ribeye are my usual picks. Don't forget they serve Brunch as well. I've tried that twice. AMAZING!  The French Toast is to die for. I'm not sure what they dip their toast in but yum!  Chicken & Waffles are incredible and a huge portion.  I've also had the Shrimp and Eggs!  Carry out is also easy and a great option. The meals are packaged well and I live an hour away...they made the trip home and the meals were a nice treat. I'm a red wine fan and they have a couple of reds to die for. Weekends have always been busy when we're there. I like to see that. Whether it's just 2 of us or our usual group of 8 we often make reservations. I personally love the crowds, the vibe and all the socializing that goes on there with dinner. It's truly a ""neighborhood gathering place"". Our servers have been great. They know the menu well as well as the ingredients. We have not had any delays in service that have bothered us or ruined our dinner.  There are nights that we want to grab a quick dinner and make the long drive home. We can do that here too. But for me....I enjoy the staging of the menu items and love relaxing with our group. I come here to enjoy the food and company. If you haven't tried Lupo you're missing out! I'll be back again and again!","

Then they gave us the wrong order and the hostess or server lady started to argue and even pulled the ticket order and tried to show that they didnt made the mistake. When my correct order came, it was in a bowl like a kid size portion (I ordered the dinner meal), when we complained, they just gave us another bowl. The son's owner did finally apologize and comp the dinner meal. This would have been perfectly ok, since i understand that they just opened and mistakes do happen, but the fact that NOT once did they owner came to our table and asked us if everything is OK or even apologize, is just rude.

We were extremely excited to dine here as we struggle to find quality Mexican cuisine in Columbus. A couple hours before our reservation on the day of, they called us and due to an equipment issue delaying their opening until 6, they had to cancel our reservation. What I take from this as most baffling is that they couldn't even squeeze us in at a later time that evening. We would have been willing to wait. In addition, keep in mind their delayed opening was only THIRTY MINUTES after our reservation time. I believe normal reservation slots are for a minimum of NINTY MINUTES. And no possible way to accommodate us? Instead they try to offer us a discount at one of their sister restaurants, none of which offer anything close to the cuisine we were looking for. What is even more frustrating is that now they are booked out for over a week during the dinner time hours. Glad we were worthless to them to properly accommodate.

With tax and tip almost $30. The portions were very very small. Noodles are cheap so the amt of noodles is negligible when you pay $12.90 for it. There were 3 very small fried chicken pieces , about a tablespoon of chopped green onions, 2 small mushroom pieces, and about an 1/8 cup of some unknown dark shredded vege. The broth flavor was like dishwater . There were no spices added that could be tasted by either of us. These meals were terrible and outrageously priced. I cannot believe that any 5 star reviews were legitimate. One star is too much.I have eaten ramen in many restaurants in many states and countries, so I know what good ramen is.","

I went with two other people and we each tried the others food. The wings were so salty that after a single wing my lips burned for almost five minutes. My chicken ramen broth had very little flavor. The noodles themselves had good texture, but again, no flavor. The chicken breast on the side was, at least, crispy but was topped with a super salty blend that made it nearly inedible... The white rice was undercooked and crispy. At over $20 for my ramen, gyoza (which I think was from a box) and a drink, it was not a pleasant experience at all and more than half of our food was left on the table.It seems to me that ""Columbus"" has happened to this place and the hipsters are raving about the new restaurant regardless of the quality. In a few months, a new place will open and this Fukuryu Ramen will get lost in the shuffle and quietly fade into obscurity because the ramen has a hard time holding up against a $0.39 packet of Maruchan.","

Some were in dressed up, others not as much, and it was a nice day so we all went out on the patio for our own space and to not bother people inside. We ordered, and everything seemed fine, however a friend came in with a small dog and were told by our server that she can't have dogs on the patio. Sad, kind of weird for Columbus, but fine. So the friend took their dog and tried to leave. Upon going inside she was accused by the owner of sneaking the dog onto the patio and berated for even having it there. Apparently, the owner (not our server, who was polite the whole time) was also so upset by our dog sneaking shenanigans that she also called us all ""freaks.""I even asked to speak to the manager on the phone but was told she's busy and that they can't give me her information.

It was even longer before our entrees were brought out and we didn't even have time to eat because we needed to get to our show on time.

The waitress finally told us that our appetizer was burned and it was the last one. She said the manager would give us something different, on the house. I told the waitress that we would need boxes and the check because we needed to leave soon. It was over ONE HOUR that we had waited and we still didn't have our meals. Everyone around us had their food. Most of the people had come in after us and had their food long before we did. We needed to leave and thought about just leaving cash for the coffee. Our waitress was away for a while so I found someone and asked if I could pay. She couldn't help me with that and left. As we were trying to leave, the manager came with our food. We no longer wanted the food. He began rolling out excuses. He said the problem was the pizza oven. Then he said that it was the rush for the theatre crowd. He lied. That was not the issue. Everyone else was getting their food. None of the food that we got was warm. It seemed like it had been sitting for a while before we got it. The worst part was the manager making excuses. It's your responsibility as a manager, to oversee things. Just politely apologize and take responsibility for the issues. It was not the rush of theatre people. The restaurant was not that busy with people eating. Everyone else was getting their food served long before we did. Chicken strips, a wrap and fries should not take that long. There were plenty of waiters. Most of the people in the place were there for the bar (only drinking) and socializing after work. Most of the bar people had been there before we arrived. There were bartenders for them. No one else had issues getting their food. I don't understand what the problem was with ours. When I got home later that evening, I ate the food. It was not good in quality and taste. Going to a fast food drive through would have been much better food and less stress.The place is very loud. The chairs scooting on the floor are very loud. Having to deal with these issues and the manager's BS was stressful. We just wanted to enjoy a meal. I had to pay (eating in) tax and pay for the order.

The food quality is what you would expect from any bar - not horrible, not memorable. Just okay. In the last year we've probably eaten at this location over 100 times, and roughly 75+ were disappointing, while a solid 30+ were downright infuriating. Whether it's slow service (2+ hours for a simple salad with grilled chicken and a wrap), items missing from our carry out orders, or carry out orders just never even rung in which we learn when we come to pick them up, it is literally ALWAYS a hassle to deal with this place. This place is so notorious for horrible service, it has become a joke in our household where we try to guess what they'll mess up this time. If there were more restaurants within walking distance in our immediate area, we would never go to The Goat again, but we live on a food island. I decided to finally write a review tonight because, much to my surprise, The Goat found a new way to disappoint me. I placed a carry out order on the resident only LC app. I logged in using my account, prepaid, and even got a confirmation email with a summary of my order, proof of payment, and estimated pick up time. When I went to pick up my food it took 3 people to figure out what needed to be done - which was quite literally just handing me a bag of food. They asked me my name several times and asked me for payment. My food was not up front ready to be picked up, and I arrived 10 minutes AFTER the time I was quoted. I then had to show them the emailed proof of payment because they argued with me that I had not paid in advance. The app won't even allow you to submit the order without payment, so I'm not sure what the confusion was all about. Even after seeing my receipt, they struggled to determine what needed to be done. After several minutes, they finally let me leave with my food. Then, I get home and open up the containers, and much to my surprise (I should have expected this) they didn't include any buffalo sauce or ranch for the buffalo cauliflower or dressing for the salads. So, I called back to let them know what happened. They said they didn't have a manager on duty to refund me, so I would need to call back in the morning!! What is wrong with the service at this place?! How is it possible for every single person who works there to be this consistently terrible?! And what is wrong with me for continuing to put myself in this situation?! Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.","

Waitress seemed confused about other drinks that we ordered. Said she would order but they never came.  Manager came by and brought one more drink. Finally the remaining drink (a beer) showed up.  Someone finally came to take our order. We said we were in a bit of a rush. More chaos with second round of drinks. Finally went to bar myself. Said they would bring beer right over. They didn't.  One and half hours after ordering still no food. We told manager to make order to go. 1/2 hour later meal shows up. When we ordered packages , nothing matched the order. One burger that was ordered medium well was essentially raw. Per manger, Meal and drinks were complimentary . Little compensation for the nightmare we encountered. Never again.","

I assumed he was referring to the covid vaccine, but that is not specifically what he asked me. Honestly, it was none of his business but I answered him which apparently wasn't enough, as he kept hounding us. The bartender came over and said we needed to social distance, but again...no dividers or barriers in place. This is the first place I have been during covid that did not have some type of divider in place at the bar, so I assumed it was okay to sit at an empty barstool. After getting the 3rd degree from a customer and the bartender, we left and went elsewhere. If the guy was so worried about covid that he felt he had the right to ask a complete stranger something that was none of his business, then he should have stayed home! I should have politely told him that, but people are crazy these days and I was a bit afraid to. There's crazy...and now there's covid crazy!

It was actually 3 seriously over cooked chicken tenders. Nasty. The ""buttered noodles"" was a tiny dish of dry macaroni. It honestly looked like a kids' meal. I was just not interested in paying $20 for dried out overcooked chicken tenders & plain dry macaroni. The others started eating, their's was all good. After at least another 20 minutes, we flagged down a different waiter and asked for our waitress. She never came but someone else did. I apologized and said I was not at all interested in paying $20 for chicken tenders, had no interest in even eating it. She took away the plate and offered to bring me something else. By then we had been there for quite a long time and I didn't want to wait so long for another meal. We were never offered drink refills. All in all, it was not a very pleasant visit. I went in hungry and left hungry. Probably won't be going back anytime soon. :(","

A couple of days later (today, June 28, 2022), I was reviewing the bank account transactions for the card I used to pay that evening and noticed a $7 tip had been added to my debit transaction without my knowledge, and certainly without my consent.

The atmosphere was upscale and welcoming, and everyone on staff was friendly and attentive. Our servers knew the menu well and gave great recommendations.We started off with the crab cake appetizer and Caesar salad. The salad was okay, nothing out of the ordinary however the crab cake was very delicious, filled with flavour. For our main course, we ordered the filet mignon and ribeye, both were cooked to our desired medium rare (with the high price tag, I wouldn't have expected anything less). We also ordered the mushrooms and mac and cheese as sides. The sautéed mushrooms had a variety of different types mixed together which I found elevated the umami flavour. Although the mac and cheese was more on the bland side, it paired well enough with the steak. The thing that surprised me the most was how much the sauces were. It cost us $15 for 3 small cups which I thought should have been cheaper, or even come with one free sauce since no sides are included in the already high price tag on their meals. The real highlight of the meal was the drinks - we had one of the best pineapple mules and spicy margaritas we've ever had. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant specifically for their cocktails. Their food and drinks were well executed and the service was top notch (with it being newly opened, I expected this, and hopefully it stays the same in the future), perfect for a special occasion.","

I could not finish the meal, it was inedible. The best part of the meal was the three pickles I got.","

The pitas were fluffy and already separated (which is a blessing, in my opinion, because I can never cleanly open them). The hummus had a perfect ratio of sour to savory and came in a deep tub that allowed me to walk away with leftovers! Also, the man working the truck was nothing but kind and respectful, and prepared the food quickly and VERY well. My favorite dish overall was the baklava - it was sweet and soft but still a touch crispy, with filling that I could eat every day for the rest of my life!! Additionally, there were places to dispose garbage, which was a very smart thing to have that not many other food trucks bother to provide. The only thing that I would tell anyone who is planning on patronizing Koshary King is that the only drink provided is water. By no means is that a bad thing - especially because the water is ice cold - but if you're more inclined to different drinks then you might want to bring your own. Overall, it was one of the best meals that I've ever had, with tasty homemade recipes and just phenomenal customer service. 10/10, I absolutely recommend Koshary King!!","

Our group size was about 10 and our average age was around 40 years old. We were on the east side of the bar and were enjoying drinks, football, food, and company. One of my family members ordered her second beverage after being there for about two hours and was told she would not be served any further with no explanation.As a veteran of late nights in bars and understanding the gravity of maintaining a solid but enjoyable environment for all, decorum is not lost on me. Our group understands you must respect staff, managers, bartenders, and other patrons at all times. Despite the foregoing, one of my family members was told she would not be served further after a 1/2 a drink. She was not intoxicated. There was no reason and there was no explanation. Let me be clear this did not have any racial motivation or homophobic undertones. When I asked to speak to the manager, he stated a line was crossed and he stood behind his bartenders. However, he could not elucidate further. I respect that he should stand behind his team and should enforce rules. That said, he did not provide any explanation about why service was denied.Understanding the moment and maintaining decorum is important for all patrons. But tonight you missed. By the actions of your employees, you lost local and frequent guests. We have visited Grandview Cafe many times in the past with our children, and this service was unexpected and absolutely uncalled for.I have never written a review on here so I don't know if this will matter. I will, however, never bring my family to this establishment again. We will be sharing our collective experience with friends - many of those are local to the neighborhood.

We had to hold a few bar seats for the girls who were running behind and, being a bartender myself, I understand how that can be inconvenient so we said If needed we can give the seats up and sit at a table. These bartenders did not hide their blatant dislike for us at all, going off to the the end of the bar and talking about us while clearly looking over to make a point. When our joiners came, they were not offered a drink once in the 15 minutes they had sat. We cashed out and went across the street to the Local Cantina where we had a wonderful time. I will say they were great with other guests so it felt extremely personal. We are all service industry and bring nothing but good energy, but we expect it in return.

Unfortunately this place fails in execution. The menu is made up of those glorified bar foods and you have to be in the mood for it. That said, this place doesn't do this type of food all that well. The chicken sandwich I had was way over cooked and the sauce smothering it was a sour nondescript flavor. My friend had a very ordinary burger with no frills. The service, though was the breaking point. It was hard to tell if our waiter was overworked with too many tables or wasn't properly trained. In any case, he was one of those who had to be hunted down or signaled over for everything we needed, including the tab. When he gave us our checks, he did not wait the ten seconds it takes for one to place tender on the ticket but disappeared AGAIN! After a few minutes, I took the two checks and our respective cards up to the bar cashier and asked if she could check us out. Due to the computer system, he had to do it. Upset at having been summoned what he must have felt was too many times, he brought the payments on the tablets for such things and literally threw them down in a clatter on our table and stormed away. It is now ranked as the rudest and least attentive service I have ever encountered.

With Grandview Cafe being the hottest place in ALL of Grandview, it was expected that it was going to be packed. And as I had assumed every patio table and bar seat was taken.

It was the most ridiculous thing I had ever witnessed and I have worked in the food services industry for over 8 years. Someone showed up that seemed to of been one of the owners, he was speaking with employees by first name basis and making his rounds to customers. I sat at my table with empty glasses and clearly looked agitated, he looked over and did nothing. I was waiting at one point by the bar to cash out for 10 minutes and he walked by and clearly knew what I was doing and continued to walk by. I felt incredibly bad for the bartenders, I know that if I was put in the situation I would have easily walked out. They should have been prepared for this and had more servers outside.

I tried in vain to sip away feeling it was my fault for ordering it, but I could not down it at all. My friend finally called over the waitress because my glass was still over 90% full over 10 minutes later and could tell I was not going to be able to drink it. I asked if I could get a version without the honey as it was overpowering. The waitress told me she would get me another drink but that she would have to charge me for a new drink because there wasn't a manager there. I agreed to pay for another drink because I wanted something to drink with my meal, but for there not to be a manager on-site at 8pm is pretty unusual.

Unfortunately, this past weekend, my fiance went to Sidebar and the quality of service was so horrible that I felt the need to reach out and post this review.We ordered one round of tappas and cocktails, and went to order a second. The second round of food never came. We sat for 45 minutes waiting for our food, while our drinks ran out and our water ran dry. Never again did our server return to our table until we managed to catch the eye of the manager who sent him over. When we asked about where our food was, he responded: ""UH, YEAH, THAT DEFINITELY NEVER GOT ORDERED...SO, DO YOU WANT YOUR CHECK?"" Not only did the server not apologize or comp any of our drinks, the manager also chose to disregard the mistake. When we asked to speak with the manager after we paid the bill, his response was ""SO WHAT, DID YOU GET CHARGED FOR IT? (the food that never came)."" Of course we did not, because at no point was it actually rung into the computer. We said no, and he simply said ""OK, THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?"" and walked away. The problem was, of course, that we sat at the restaurant for over 2 hours, and never actually received our meal. This level of service is absolutely unacceptable. We will never return to Sidebar, and I suggest you consider looking elsewhere also. If you are looking to spend a nice evening out, you are far better spending your time and money at a restaurant that cares about the service they provide to their guests, such as Lindeys, Barcelona or one of the many Cameron Mitchell restaurants in the area.","

First, it appears that no one bothers to clean the windows as they had fingerprints on the front door as well as on the glass windows at the hostess area. Second, there was no one at the door to greet us even though the restaurant was fairly quiet. We were eventually greeted and led to a table near the window. The food was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. The service was okay and the service personnel pleasant although our waiter was a bit too chatty for our taste. The ladies room needed some attendance. After reading the reviews we were very disappointed. I heard someone (a manager perhaps) stating that there was a recent change of management - not sure what this meant.","

Apparently the bartender has the option of closing whenever he wants, because he ignored me and made it clear he would not serve me. At that time one of the people at the bar offered me her drink.

The food taste-wise was sub-par, especially for the price. The calamari was gross and cheaply orchestrated--its Chilean sauce tasted like the crap you get with frozen spring rolls. The seasonal special, the roasted sea bass, which was specifically recommended to us by our waiter, was extremely disappointing. It tasted like gross, previously frozen fish sat atop of a can of campbells chicken and dumpling soup. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box. The lobster Mac n cheese? Like a box of velveeta. I wish that was the worst of it. We should have known something was wrong by how rubbery the sea bass was. We have never been so sick in our lives. If you've never had food poisoning from fish, consider yourself very lucky. We sat down for dinner hungry and happy and left the restaurant listless and ill. This completely ruined my husbands birthday and the worst $200 we ever spent. I'm appalled a high end seafood restaurant could perform so poorly. Needless to say, we will never return again.","

We decided to take a friend of ours from out of town to a Mitchell's restaurant just because of how nice it was supposed to be. The bread basket was fun for the kids because they love pretzels but it would have been nice with some dipping sauce. The kids had mac and cheese which looked amazing but was very blah. The pasta was overcooked and it needed seasoning. It was the first time I didn't see my kids clear a bowl of mac and cheese. I had a ceasar salad which was amazing taste wise but cut into such thin limp pieces that I needed to use my knife to push it onto the fork. I then tried the lobster. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. Maybe I'm just a little spoiled having eaten Maine lobster that I was expecting fresh and tender. Not dry and mediocre. My husband was satisfied with his steak but our guest was not. He ordered a steak also but was insisting it was not the portion the menu had promised. Let me add that our waiter was amazing. He was polite and very attentive. Once our friend explained he wasn't satisfied with his meal the waiter told us that all of the meat was weighed but that he would speak to the manager. Like any good waiter would. Now here is where I personally got angry and decided the experience went downhill. The manager was obviously standing in a corner and made no attempt to come to the table and rectify the situation. He merely stood in the background and let his waiter do his job. The waiter politely came back to the table and said that this was the proper amount of meat and that it came straight from his manager. Now considering how expensive this supposed amazing restaurant is, I would assume that the manager would want his costumers to come back. Especially when there are so many restaurants to choose from. Not feel like they are stupid and wrong for not liking their meal. We love high end restaurants and were expecting more. The restaurant is beautiful and the waiter was amazing but between the food and the manager I give it two stars. I wouldn't go back. There are so many restaurants to choose from which is why a good manager would have made his costumers happy. Not let them leave with a bad taste in their mouth.

We were dressed very casually so sat at the bar. My first two choices for a glass of wine were ""sold out"" according to the bartender, but he let us taste another that was quite expensive. We opted for a less expensive choice. My friend asked for a glass of water also and the waiter said 'sure' and said he would return with a menu. She and I sat for the next hour with absolutely no contact from the 3 bartenders who were working in front of us, busy doing sidework and watching the football game. A barback came by to replenish supplies, smiled and said hello and my friend asked him for water, which he obliged (thank you). Still nothing from the bartenders - and there were very few other patrons. Two men to the right of me had conversations with one bartender, ordered food and had dinner and their drinks replenished. Four men sat to our left and were immediately engaged in conversation by another bartender, had lengthy menu discussions and their dinner order taken- yet she and I sat in the middle as though we were completely invisible. As soon as she put cash down, a bartender appeared and without making eye contact whisked it away, only speaking briefly when he brought the change back to ask if the rest was meant for him. I've been here before with a male friend who frequents the place regularly and had the bartenders fawn all over him, but this is the second time I have come (once alone and now once with another female) and been nearly completely disregarded.

I prefer other locations, but she wanted to go to the one in the Short North. Mistake #1. Their valet service was way backed up because of something going on in the Short North area. After getting inside, we were made to wait at the bar long beyond our reservation. The bartenders were very nice, but I wanted a table.We were finally seated, and our server came over and introduced himself. Very nice guy. He told us about the specials and said he'd be back with some water. Well, he was gone a long time and then finally came over with ice water in the kind of glasses you serve hot liquor drinks in. I laughed and busted his chops a little bit and asked him about it and he apologized and said, ""I'm really sorry it took so long to get you water, but I couldn't find any water glasses. We're so busy tonight and running out of everything."" Now, I can understand being busy, but these people charge $30-70 for A SINGLE STEAK! You really mean to tell me that they can't afford to make sure that they have enough water glasses to make sure their customers can drink water???Alright, whatever. I order a nice bottle of wine and ask my server if he'd mind decanting it and he said of course. After a few minutes later he came back and said, ""I'm really sorry, but all of the decanters are being used."" Now I'm just annoyed, and my wife can tell, and that makes me feel awful because it's her birthday. Again, whatever.So, finally, after a long time we get our food. I ordered a 12 ounce filet and she ordered a 16 ounce lobster tail. My steak was both over-cooked and cold (someone explain this to me). Her lobster tail was over-cooked, chewy and SMELLED burnt.Oh, and then I told my server, ""Excuse me, but the guy who brought our dinner forgot to bring out serving spoons for our side dishes,"" and he informed me that he'd be right back with them and apologized but they were no longer serving spoons with side dishes. What? Anyway....Now I'm really angry. Free dessert was the answer to their completely incapable handling of my evening. Woo-hoo. That hardly makes up for my wife's ruined birthday dinner.I will say our server was a really nice and attentive guy. The staff here is always great. The manager came by and apologized which was nice, but still hardly made up for the experience. It's the rest of the restaurant/food/atmosphere that makes this place a horrible place to go.We'll stick to other choices from now on... like ones with water glasses and wine decanters and spoons.Save yourself a lot of money and have a much better meal somewhere else.","

I loved the plush booths, color scheme, and décor. Unfortunately the menu was considerably less delightful. Their vegetarian options are currently limited to a grilled cheese sandwich or sugary fried dough items. They do offer you the opportunity to leave off the meat on their breakfast items, but that would leave you with basically a biscuit and potatoes, I guess, and you're still paying the full price of the meaty dish. A vegetarian protein or beans or tofu or nuts on the lunch menu would be most welcome. I didn't see many considerations for other dietary needs, either. My group was overall disappointed with the portion sizes. The burgers were very small and the pile of fries that accompanied our sandwiches were laughable. One patron quipped, ""Oh, how nice! They're watching our calories for us!"" Everyone at the table got charged for a $4 coffee whether they ordered it or not, though we did get those charges reversed upon request. I am willing to give them another try, because their atmosphere is pretty enjoyable, but I think I'll wait for a few months until they work out the kinks and hopefully they'll add some more considerate vegetarian options.","

We generally love all the CAM restaurants and can always find food to eat. Unfortunately, the take out service at Hudson 29 has turned us off of eating there anymore.The food is generally good, like most CAM restaurants, but I've lost count of the number of issues we've had with their take out, and some in person requests. They consistently mess it up, either through not delivering the food correctly or through forgetting items. We've had food and wine left out of orders, and dairy or gluten free requests not handled correctly. This has happened repeatedly over the years, making me think the issue is not a kitchen or staff one, but a management one.I will happily continue to frequent other CAM restaurants, and suggest them to others, but I would suggest anyone with dietary concerns, or anyone ordering takeout, stay away from Hudson 29.","

Three days before the dinner, I called again to confirm the reservation for the private room. I was told it was all set. Then the morning of the dinner, I get a call from Hudson 29 to confirm the reservation. I told them that the dinner is still going forward. The party gets to the restaurant and the private room was already occupied. They tell the party that the private room was not reserved for them only a table in the dining room was reserved. They had to actually push tables together in the dining room to accommodate what was supposed to be a private business dinner. I called the manager and confronted her about them telling the party that I did not ask for the private room. She told me that there was nothing written down and that it was a miscommunication. That is an error on their part then because I spoke with their establishment three times about this reservation. I am an executive assistant and book private rooms for dinner meetings all the time so for them to tell the party upon arrival that the private room was not booked is unbelievable. They messed up, lied about it and did nothing to make it better. I will not be using this restaurant again.","

It could have easily been mistaken for a slider, but they aren't on the menu.

When I spoke to the 4th person, who I guess was the manager/owner/, im not really sure who, no one ever identified themselves, she at least spoke fluent english. I was very polite with and simply expressed that I was disappointed and that they lost my business. ( Under old ownership, we ate here 4 times a month at least).  The woman immdiately started using obvious defense mechanisms and blaming me. The first words out of her mouth were, ""I'm not even the one who makes the food here"" .I told her how I asked for the manager and had to talk to 3 people before her and she said it was because no one can speak English. I suggested that could be part of the food problem because I just think it would be impossible to employ and instuct someone whom you couldnt even verbally communicate with.Despite how polite I was, she told me I was being rude and mean for calling. Not once did she ask why I didn't like my food, or say I'm sorry, or can you give us another chance, nothing. I also think its odd all of the bad reviews of here are in the filtered (aka dont count and unviewable) section","

The bagels are pretty good. The coffee is decent. But if you're going there to consume more than that, I'd go somewhere else.

Try toasting the bread guys.... I might have given it a chance had I been able to eat it. But it was tasteless, soggy, and just not worth whatever I paid for it. Because this place is so conveniently located to my house, I've given it so many chances. The sushi is a no-go. For that price I can go to any other place in town and have sushi that's fantastic. I wish this place would pick an identity. It has such potential; they already have a loyal following (but why!).

The outdoor seating drew me in - it's gorgeous and comfortable with long upholstered sofas and gas fireplaces at each roomy and airy booth. I was surprised that there was no chardonnay by the glass on the menu, but my server brought me one anyway. I'm allergic to onions, so I couldn't order what he suggested. The falafel & hummus bowl that I did order was amazing! The falafel was cooked to perfection, and the added pickled beets, olives, eggplant, and dressing made for a lovely meal. I had such a pleasant experience, I thought that I'd try it a second time. I was told by a new server the next night that there was no chardonnay by the glass. I assured him that there was, and, after a while, he brought me one. I ordered the sweet potato salad, which is described as including chopped greens. What I received was a plate of a few sweet potatoes quarters and four leaves of something green. Not at all satisfying. My third try (I was enamored of the outdoor area), I ordered the Cold Lo Mein bowl. Not wanting raw tuna, I chose the beet poke option. The noodles were tasty, but the beets, which were raw and dredged in salt, were inedible. OK, one more try the next night. This time, another new server, after being gone a long time, said the the sauvignon blanc that I ordered wasn't available. After I corrected him on two counts -- wrong wine, chardonnay is available -- he took his sweet time to bring it to me. What to eat? I had enjoyed the falafel/hummus combo so much that I ordered it again. What a mistake! The falafel was rock solid on the outside and disintegrated immediately on the inside. I had to remind my server that I should be getting some pita bread with the order. The eggplant was so tough that I ask to ask for a serrated knife to cut it. Didn't really need it, though, because it was tasteless. The worst part, though, was that this time, there were raw onions mixed in. So, come for the ambience, stay for a drink (if you can get one), and take your chances with the menu.","

He got to me and said I apologize if you didn't think I didn't do enough for you and then proceeded to tell me I am not allowed to yell about the plastic in my milk shake I told him I told my neighbor who asked and if it hadn't happened I would not be saying anything at all. I told him he never apologized he didn't ask if I was cut he just told me I was wrong and it wasn't glass.

The restaurant is in the old sushi restaurant in Easton town center square.Decor is nice- bathrooms are too dingy! #1 The burgers were -avg to below average, too big, and conceptually not appealing A piece of brisket on a burger is kind of silly... the patty is just a patty and not flavored in any way??#2 All the waitresses pretty much ignored us, not until we went over and asked to be served did someone come over.Mom ordered a blueberry drink - and did not seem well prepared or even tasty - aren't sugar and alcohol usually hard to mess up ?

I like to eat some fries with my beer and then eat my dinner... This sucked much more as the bar was 6 feet away from my table - this could have taken 30 seconds to do.#4My wife ordered a veggie burger, which was a weird patti with some greens - Horrible - they took it off the bill as well -Which was the only good thing that happened here.

Think twice about dining at Lemon Grass, and read several of the one or two star ratings here and elsewhere. This location has a real problem with employees who are high on various substances. Our waitress was so heavily stoned or sedated that it took her over an hour to bring a single bottle of beer from the bar just 10 feet away. Although she wrote down our order as we read from the menu, what she bought out 90 minutes (yes, 1 1/2 hours) later had no resemblance to anything we asked for, except one dish that had part of one meal on it, and part of another order across the table on a single plate. She proceeded to argue this what we ordered, and did not understand why two unrelated people did not want to eat select portions of an incomplete order off of the same plate. For the first time in my four decades of dining across this nation, we left without getting a single bite of food. My generous out of town guest left $40.00 in cash on the table, which I objected to, as the only item we were actually served was a single light beer.I will never again set foot in this place as the experience was so remarkably bad. There are plenty of much higher quality and much less high waitstaff (and God forbid, the kitchen staff) just a few blocks in both directions. I strongly advise you to consider any restaurant in the Short North other than the Lemon Grass Fusion Bistro.I place this Yelp review here as a public service but I rarely visit Yelp.

I am a huge donator to such organizations and we make a conscience effort to eat out often and to always support small local business.

"Alqueria Farmhouse Kitchen","https://www.yelp.com/biz/alqueria-farmhouse-kitchen-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Syed S.",5,"2024-01-25","We don't often dine in this part of town because of parking, so on our visit to Alqueria, we deliberately picked a weeknight to avoid parking hassles. Thankfully, we found nearby street parking very easily. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and cozy, and while small, it still has a couple of longer tables for larger groups (definitely recommend reservations in advance), and also has a full bar. Our server, Cat, was top notch. He was very personable, made great suggestions, and checked in on us regularly throughout the evening.As a restaurant that offers farm-to-table food, the menu here is deliberately condensed. If you are looking for a place with a huge variety of microwaved frozen food options, check out Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the fried chicken and the salmon. Both were delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection, and the accompanying grits was a nice complement. The chicken is a large portion, and the honey hot sauce elevated its flavor. Even though we were full, we ordered the dark chocolate truffles for dessert, and while they were good, they disappeared fast. As a chocoholic, I do not recommend this as a shareable dessert! All the other menu options looked great, so we will definitely be back here to try them out!","Lewis Center, OH",65,137,1257

The staff is very friendly and helpful with menu. The food itself I sort of felt had been overstated! With all the potential in the world, I felt that the sweet potatoes weren't necessarily anything but that and most of the dishes lacked the sort of wow factor that I had anticipated after reading reviews. Good food for maybe a weeknight after work.","OH, OH",0,14,387

Hands down I recommend the Mushrooms for an appetizer. Second time I have had them and they are phenomenal. If they have the Duck Confit Gnocchi that is a must too. Confit is pronounced kawn-fee if you're wondering, I always second guess it.Ambience - is an upscale-rustic setting and they carry out the farmhouse motif within. It's a great vibe. Parking - Parking is always a bit challenging in the area but street parking is available on King Ave via the Park Columbus and ParkMobile App.Reservations - definitely a good choice given limited seating. To book reservations, you can visit www.alqueriacolumbus.com or you can go to tbdine.comDefinitely recommend dining here. It's a higher price point but everything tastes so good. Locally sourced where possible and definitely farm fresh in flavor.","Columbus, OH",1277,711,889

The location is right before Victorian Village. There is only street parking so keep that in mind. The outside decor is really nice with the lights and the inside was nice and homey as well. We had a reservation so we were seated right away and put our orders in fairly quickly. My boyfriend and I shared the shrimp appetizer. It was delicious. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. The oil and red pepper flakes were delicious with the bread. For our entree, we split the short rib. It was good but will probably try something else next time. The mule I got for my drink was delicious. I definitely could have had another. Overall, we had a great time and I would go back to try something new!","Columbus, OH",11,119,783

The place is very warm and cozy with friendly staffs.  Our server Cat, was great, friendly and attentive.  We ordered the pan roasted blackened salmon and the buttermilk fried chicken for the entrée.  Salmon was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The fried chicken was on top of pureed potatoes, broccolini, and a hot honey sauce.  It was delish.  For desert, we ordered the dark decadent truffles drizzled with salted caramel salt.  The chocolate was very rich, but the salted caramel gave it a nice balance.  Overall, we had a great experience.

Incredible 1-2 punch and the half-off bottles of sparkling wine make for a great Monday dinner. Because why not? Alqueria is a farm-to-table style restaurant and as a fan of farm-to-table it's probably the best in Columbus and rivals similar style restaurants anywhere I've been in the world. I've also been fortunate enough to book their large dining table for a group and it was a blast! Though one downside is that room with everyone talking can get as loud as a concert. Seriously. I also enjoyed their crème brûlée though the crème was just a tad bit burnt in some spots. Decent bourbon selection at fair prices. Great food. What's not to love?","Columbus, OH",37,159,799

We were able to make reservations for 11, which was great! We walked to the restaurant because we live just across the street. We were seated at a long table in the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is semi-casual classy with dim lighting, which makes sense because it's slightly pricey. Our server was very tentative and made sure to be available whenever we needed something. He continuously checked on us and remained close by. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken. Thankfully, our served warned us as we sat down that this meal takes a little longer to prepare than some of the other dishes, as everything is made in house. Because of this, my meal was able to come out at the same time as everyone else. The chicken was a little difficult to eat in my opinion. I probably shouldn't have ordered something that required me to use my hands so much before a nice event (lol). Regardless, the mashed potatoes and the broccolini were seasoned perfectly. Next time I visit, I'd like to try the farm house burger. A few people at my table ordered the burger, and I was jealous it looked so good!!","University District, Columbus, OH",3,58,1180

Since it was happy hour, cocktails were half price which is one of the best deals in Columbus! But the best part is the cocktails are truly fantastic. I had two different offerings, both made with their in house bourbon and both cocktails were well balanced, unique, and delicious.

Plenty of booths, lighting, and space for people to feel comfortable. I'm rating 3/5 for two reasons: 1 being that the service isn't anything special. & 2 because it is PRICEY. Especially for being so close to a college campus full of broke college students. The burrito itself cost $14.50. Definitely don't recommend if you're on a budget.

The side of potatoes it came with were great - crunchy potato medley. Definitely would recommend hitting this place up for brunch! The palace itself is such a cute place, with their own coffee barista side on the end. They have spacious seating with low tops and high top tables.

I chose the Schmoozer topped with house made pastrami. It was exceptional! The potato latkes were among the best I've had. The pastrami was spectacular. I suggested to the woman who waited on me that it would be the perfect topper for a pastrami burger (famous in Utah - look it up). They even had RC Cola! As an added bonus, she gave me a cup of their ""Best in the State"" tomato basil soup and the description was spot-on - creamy, rich, warm, and simply amazing. I loved it.I took two of the latkes home. I ate one for dinner that night. The other I used as a Lenten Friday lunch, topped with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and grated parmigiano reggiano.

As they run a successful catering business on weekends, they are only open 8-2 Monday through Friday.  The place was pretty packed being a holiday, but they did have a table for us.  My dad and I each ordered The Zaftig which are half sized roast beef, corned beef, and turkey.   Zaftig is used to describe a curvy person but it is also the name of a famous Jewish deli in Boston we may try this summer and I am just seeing that there is a brewing company in the Columbus area with that name.  My wife had the Gina's Jewish omlette with smoked salmon.  All of our food was wonderful and is on par with the great Jewish delis on the east coast we have tried but for a better value.  To drink I had Dr. Brown's Cream Soda and my wife had a coffee which were also great.  I think the best feature of the restaurant are the owners that talked to us and the other diners.  Not sure if I am correct, but it looks like their names are Scotty and Gina.  They are so friendly and treat you like family even if they meet you for the first time.  I don't think we have ever dined in a restaurant or gone to a business where the staff makes you feel quite that way.  I was also wearing a Baltimore Ravens shirt the day after the Cincinnati Bengals narrowly beat them.  A guy from a nearby table came up to me and told me he was sorry and that the Ravens played a good game.  The lady at the ticket counter at the airport told me the same thing.  This made us all root for the Bengals until they lost to the Chiefs.  It just shows how friendly everyone is in Ohio.","Silver Spring, MD",4991,475,1853

I always get the fish and chips, my girlfriend always gets the burger. The pretzel bites are awesome and the cheese sticks are always hot and melty. They do offer a decent amount of food with the appetizers and with the entree's so if you plan to order appetizers, bring your A-game appetite and a friend.The service is also always outstanding. For the best option of seating I recommend arriving early for dinner around 4-5pm or lunchtime. There is close parking available early, as well, otherwise the walk may be just further out into the parking lot as this is in the Graceland Shopping Center.There is always decent music and if you sit at the bar a better view of the tv which is usually showing news or sports.I love the servers here. Never had a bad server, ever. Always attentive and will keep your soda, water, tea, and lemonade topped off. Clean restrooms with an interesting photo set to look at if you forgot your phone or just looking around if you aren't staying in there long. When I lived a few blocks down years ago, I wish this place was here. It would been well worth the walk from the Beechwold neighborhood. Their happy hour pricing is also very enticing as well. Portion size is smaller along with the price but if you are ordering an entree (not happy hour priced) with it, you will still get your fill. I highly recommend this place!

Over the years I continued to follow their story, especially during the 2020 riots, which they were affected by greatly. The only thing is that I always ordered delivery... but over the weekend, I finally made it in-person. I wish I hadn't waited as long as I did, because it was awesome! They are tucked away downtown, off Gay St, right around the corner from High St. There's street parking out front and a few parking garages close by. They have a cute little patio right out front on the sidewalk and a giant window, which was great for people watching. The service was friendly right from the jump. We were seated at a cozy table in the corner and served water and menus right away. My boyfriend and I each ordered a drink and we shared an order of pop fries. The fries were fire, but I wasn't a fan of my cocktail. I think next time I will just get some sake. As for entrees, I was excited to try the vegetarian ramen, as vegetarian broth can be harder to find. It was flavorful but I could have added some sriracha, hoisin sauce, or chili oil to up the ante a bit. The veggies were cooked just right, but the noodles were the star of the show. As delicious as it was, the serving was huge and I couldn't finish it all. Needless to say, I'm excited to visit more in-person. The ambience was fun, perfect for a group of friends or a date night and the food was delicious. What more could I ask for?","Columbus, OH",3866,1285,1466

To make a long story short, it was so good I ordered two nights in a row. Yep! No shame... And I'd do it again in a heartbeat!Both times I ordered the vegetable spring roll as a starter. I'm not going to lie here folks, I believe this is the best I've had in Columbus. I highly recommend it! I don't usually dip these things in yum yum sauce but theirs is delicious and pairs great with the flavors in the roll. The panko shrimp rice bowl was a good portion of food and I couldn't put it down. Along with the rice and shrimp it includes some lightly pickled veggies and lettuce.

The appetizers and entrees are pretty amazing here. I have not found a dish that I do not like yet. My go-tos are the crispy chicken dumplings, wings, turkey tan tan, and the Korean #BBQ #CHICKEN  bowl. If you can't do spicy, make sure that you tell them to adjust the spice level to your liking. I usually top my meal off with the passionfruit green tea. The service is average for the most part. Meaning they'll take your order with a pleasant smile and get it right for the most and it's relatively quick and speedy service. Ambiance kind of depends on the time of day. During the day time you have a more businessy type of feel. Most folks come in with their teams long enough to eat within 30 mins and then be out. The evening though is a little more casual and laid back and somewhat romantic depending on what's going on outside the large windows. #greentea #ramen #wings #cbusfoodie #eeeeeats #foodie #columbusfoodie","Columbus, OH",21,104,1009

You know it's fast food but you feel like they care about the flavors and the ambiance. The servers were friendly and respectful--maybe a weird word to use but I really felt the two gentlemen working this this night were great -- making eye contact, explaining the foods, making sure you had what you needed. There were two of us for dinner on a Thursday night. Both got hummus bowls, one with chicken (very very tasty, great spices) and one with brisket (love!). Some cukes and radishes, along with house sauce (nice garlicky tang). We also ordered fries - made as you order them, so wonderfully fresh and hot.  Served with a pita.

"Brassica","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brassica-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Adam S.",3,"2023-10-24","TLDR: decent food, high prices, lackluster portions I used to love brassica and would come regularly 2018-2020. I thought the food tasted good enough and it was different enough that it earned my business.But when I returned on my last visit to Columbus I was very disappointed. I ordered online because I was in a hurry and needed something quick. I placed the order at 1:50pm and it said it would be ready at 2:10pm so I was a quoted a quick turn around. I arrived around 2:15pm and everything was ready except the fries but they said they would make them fresh which I didn't mind.I'll start with the bowl, I got lentils and rice and half greens. They definitely went heavy on the greens. Chicken was my choice of protein and they definitely skimped out. You can't see it in the picture and I could hardly find it when I was eating it. I got every topping possible to max my portion size and I will say the toppings were delicious outside of the eggplant. The eggplant was sloppy and mushy but still had pretty good flavor. The hummus, cucumber, and pickled beats stand out as winner and are must gets. I would recommend getting at least two sauces I got special sauce and tahini on the side and put both on top and it really enhanced the bowl. Overall 7/10.Now to the fries. I have to say I am extremely disappointed with the portion size. I appreciate that they tried to make them fresh for me but it was at least 30% less than what I was expecting. I also noticed they skimped on the special sauce. You can see in my picture the container is barely half full. This is a shame because it's a good sauce and lovely to dip the well seasoned fries in.The last thing to mention here is this place is very pricey for what it's worth. My total order was two bowls, 1 chicken for me and 1 brisket for my girlfriend, brassica fries, and a mint pink lemonade (also very good) but the total price was $40. To me that's outrageous considering how much they skimped on the good stuff. For reference I went to shawarma bite and priced my equivalent order and it came out to just over $25. Personally I'll be saving the $15 from now on.","West Chester, OH",4,34,2127

Don't let the modest street-side appearance (if you notice it, that is) disuade you, this place is amazing!Walking in you are greeted by a build your own adventure kind of meal. There's a placard on the wall to help get you started: salad, sandwich (which is really a freshly made pita stuffed with your options) or a hummus plate. The guy at the counter said I'd get the biggest bang for my belly with a salad and that guided me completely!  Excellent call!  My disclaimer: I like all things Mediterranean and I like most all vegetables. (I'm convinced Brussel sprouts are the devil's fruit.)My base: 1/2 rice, 1/2 greens.Pita chips were my cronch for texturePickled sweet beets and, cukes + radishes1 scoop of hummus and 1 scoop of baba. (The baba was incredible)Spicy carrots, eggplant, and cauliflower tabbouleh Why do we have brisket in a Mediterranean spot? Who cares! GET IT. It was so delicate and flavorful. Why wasnt there more on my plate?! Oh because I also asked for falafel. Which is made to order. ALSO delicious! Everything topped with tahini dressing. To hide the brisket from me and slow me down, I'm sure.If you take a careful gander of the picture posted with this review, you'll see the brassica fries photobombing my salad... I'd skip these if I were you. They were heavy, maybe because I was having so much fun playing with my food. They did pair well when dipped in the baba. (Btw, in case you were wondering, baba is a smoky eggplant dip with tahini, evoo and roasted garlic)The drink: the brassarita. An adult slushy minty pink lemonade spiked with tequila and worth every sip of brain freeze. Does anyone else know how hard it is to try to not physically express they have brain freeze every two sips of their drink while in public?! Anyhoo, great experience for a fresh and delicious fast casual restaurant. I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in the area.Mint pink lemonade brassarita","Carmel Valley, San Diego, CA",0,76,2017

I am glad that (compared to other recent reviews) the glazed lamb bacon is back for this location only, so in a heartbeat, I opted to try that in a sandwich, customizing with the hummus, house sauce, and some vegetables. I also tried the Brassica fries and falafel, both of which were excellent. Normally fries cost quite a lot but this one was only $2.90 for a sizable portion, served up with their house sauce. They even made it fresh to order. Falafel is 4 pieces for $3.90 so standard pricing, and it was not too dry. Dip it with the house sauce - thank me later.The sandwich is a pita sandwich and is soft and warm. While at first glance the server puts few ingredients in, there are actually a lot of ingredients, perhaps the illusion. I really loved the glazed lamb bacon as it was slightly sweet but still carried forth the lamb taste. I was very stuffed after the sandwich, and getting the fries and falafel locked in enough food for the rest of the day.

Tables are a bit high for her.  We got her plain fries and a veggie plate.  She sampled some new things, didn't like the olives unsurprisingly.  Did love the feta.  And, loved the brat corndogs.  They are good brats, with really just a very thin batter, deep fried.  Served in coarse mustard.  Very good.  I tried the fries- thin and crispy and a huge portion.  Also some of the veggie tray: fresh and tasty.  I expected the brat corndogs to be a gimmick, and the rest to be typical bar food.  I was wrong.

This place is more of a fast casual restaurant as you order up front, grab a number, and choose any available seat. We got the pancake balls (Katalina's organic pumpkin-apple butter) with sweet and spicy bacon, as well as the breakfast tacos. The pancake balls are filling and full of batter, but it has a nice balance of not-too-sweet filling inside and a side of maple syrup if you desire to increase the amount of sweetness to the dish. I really enjoyed the spice kick of the bacon and the bacon is slightly crispy but super flavorful. The breakfast tacos are great but not too amazing as I'm not too big of a fan of sour cream, but it is quite creamy and flavorful. There's not too much of chorizo but it was nonetheless satisfying.

Having never been to their downtown, this was running on pure hype and a less than stellar introduction at Goood Friend's. They landed in a solid location - way more parking and easy to get to. The seating area is a little tight, for how popular they seem to be. When I went - between lunch and dinner - they were still with a FULL house, and a line to the door. Just that right kind of busy, where it's not loud, and they're quickly taking orders and some people stay and some leave. I opted not to gamble on seating (plus, by myself, I'm not taking up space when they're new and cranking out food). The service - as good as can be! They apologized for the wait - but the wait was being in line and the cashier explaining the same thing repeatedly because the people ordering didn't listen to him say the same thing to the person in front. ""What are you known for? What's Wario's way? What are spuds?"" I felt like I could've been quizzed by the time I ordered and known all the answers. Grabbed a Mexican Coke, a steak (Wario's way) and house spuds. The sandwich - okay, this was cheeeeesy. It was a good balance across the bread, so there was maybe one heel end that didn't get hit by meat, onions, and cheese. The spuds were tasty - and a lot.Honestly, for the price, you could split an order of both and come out ahead. It's really worth going, ordering two sandwiches with someone, and STILL having leftovers, because it's filling. So - it's very hyped up. It is a little pricey. But they do deliver on flavor, great service, and a nice location. I'll be back any time I hit up laughing ogre or just need a sandwich to last for two meals.ETA: met up with a few friends to grab some food. Again - great service, they were getting people out pretty quickly that we were able to land a seat.

The place is small and loud and has been renovated to look like a modern version of a hole in the wall...odd late 70's vibe but built with new materials? Not sure if that was the intent, but in 10 years when the walls are yellow from grease and the booths are trashed, it will be appropriate. Takeout is probs the best way to go unless you don't mind someone watching your every move while they stand in line. Menu is somewhat limited, which is refreshing in the current environment of overthought, complex menus. Counter service was excellent...literally service with a smile. Wait was not too long, but somewhat awkward because standing room is limited. Ended up having to line up against the wall by the bathrooms like a middle school dance. Now, the food. It's not great. It's not terrible, but I don't understand all the hype. I have had ""East Coast Inspired"" food elsewhere and it was much better. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the food tasted flat. I had The Steak, Warios way. The best thing about this was the bread. Any flavor the meat had was drowned out by the cheese which has a mildly bitter/pungent flavor that overpowers everything else. Also had the house spuds, which were good and crisp, but again overpowered by the rosemary and parm. Lastly, the price. Good lord, the price. - $19 for a cheese steak sandwich- $6 for 8-12 oz of fried fingerling potatoes - 15% tip because the guy at the counter was great and the kitchen staff were hustling. I clocked out at almost $30 for a Philly steak sandwich and spuds. This Columbus foodie scene madness has to stop. It's no wonder people under the age of 35 are struggling to get by. Between skyrocketing rent, crushing school debts and $30 sandwiches, there is no way to get ahead. One of Wario's values stated on the website is:""Feeding the community and giving them the quality they deserve""This food is nowhere near worth $30. Raise the quality and keep the prices, or keep the quality and lower the price. Either way will work, but right now ""the community"" deserves better.","Columbus, OH",0,52,2184

The waffle I did not enjoy at all. I thought it would be savory but felt like they just put Mac and cheese on top of a sweet waffle, so really odd combo.

The woman behind the bar lacked  customer service.   When she  stood directly in front of me for at least three minutes (I timed it.)   never spoke and avoided eye contact.   She spoke to her colleague behind and around the bar and even made herself a drink but  never acknowledged me.     Friends of mine were actually coming to meet me. But I texted them and said this isn't place and we went some place else.  Before I left, I asked to speak with her. She saw me standing, walked past where I was standing  and went to the front and looked in a drawer.  When I started to walk toward her she came over.  I shared my experience and she stared and said thank you.   Funny thing, she said to her colleague how she wanted the place to be busy because she was ready.  I guess I wasn't the type her customer she was ready for.   I do want to acknowledge the host when I arrived and the gentleman behind the bar were professional.","Columbus, OH",0,4,1004

That being said, even as Italian food, the food was not impressive for the price point. The service is super slow and we were waiting 30 minutes until our appetizer order was taken after the server and the chef got into an argument in front of us (even though there weren't that many customers in the restaurant to justify the pace). The best part of the night was the charcuterie board (pictured) and the fresh bread they served, which was just perfection and a very interesting combination. Rest of the food we ordered was cold and unimpressive. We ordered steak which was served cold but they already took so long we decided to have it as is. The meat was tender though the taste was good. All the pasta was so poorly served I had to dig through my plate just to discover what I was eating. Tiramisu was so far from being food with the lady fingers so soaked in coffee the biscuits layer was nearly invisible. For the price and the way others had reviewed it, I was expecting much more. I also couldn't find the items others had tried which is likely because of how quickly the menu changes. I wish they could perfect the most popular items instead of making weird combinations. Adding more diversity to the menu in terms of having less Italian influence and more global would be also be better (unless it is listed as new American by mistake here and it is meant to be Italian with a twist)The seating was nice specially if you were in a group of larger than two. The seating for two was not as good as they were lined up against the wall and over a step. It felt too constricting.","Columbus, OH",2,24,1859

This truly was the perfect location to celebrate a life well lived. You instantly see why Karen enjoyed this place. The fact that the restaurant opened early for this special event shows a lot. The Chef, bartender, and servers were wonderful. They were all very attentive to guests. The thoughtfulness of the bartender creating a Karen cocktail was a beautiful touch. The group shot/toast was also very nice. The Chef's presentation of his charcuterie board was gorgeous! Not only gorgeous but deliciously paired meats, cheeses and spreads. I complimented him on the event and he humbly stated that the family was responsible for the majority of the special touches. I appreciated his honesty. Although I did not have the usual dining experience, the service and ambiance is enough to make me come back. It's got a modern and classy vibe, but not pretentious. The basement dining area is worth experiencing too, I imagine on a normal day it being dimly lit and romantic.

The drink tasted weird but it might just be me. Pasta is alright, nothing amazing but I enjoyed it. The main disappointment is the pork pasta, which was recommended as one of the most popular dishes by our waiter. Both my husband and girlfriend got it and both thought it was meh. The pork is not very different from a deep fried pork cutlet from a Japanese ramen joint. And the pasta... while they did remind you it is cold on the menu, it has little to none flavor - just a bland pesto/olive oil mixture. Definitely disappointing considering the price point.Dessert was the only highlight of the night. The s'mores cheesecake is delicious and well presented.

Plas is the best bang for your buck restaurant in all of Columbus.You get exceptional quality, innovative cuisine, one of the best ambiences you can find in the 614, and one of the best chefs and service departments in Ohio for beyond fair prices. The menus change with the seasons and Chef Jamie George is a master of his craft and ultra tedious with the details. Jackie and Eric - the co-proprietors - are beyond hospitable, highly knowledgable of both the menu ingredients and corresponding drinks, and provide an at-home feel for all guests.

We travel all around Columbus in search of great meals and hidden gems. Third and Hollywood was next on our list of places to try. Our favorite spots are Kitchen Social, Koso, Pho Social, J. Gilberts, Nada and Hoyo, so using those favorites as a frame of reference for this meal.The restaurant was uncomfortably chilly inside, but the ambiance was nice otherwise. It's a smaller space and it was absolutely packed. Waited 30 minutes past our reservation for a table.The cheddar biscuits we had as an appetizer were absolutely delicious! My favorite part of the meal for sure and a close second to Kitchen Social. For dinner, I had the recommended special, which was the 16oz ribeye. My SO got the 6 oz filet. 16 oz is a lot of steak! I was absolutely stuffed after eating about three quarters of it. Also paying the price today for the mid-rare choice with visit from a stomach bug. My SO enjoyed the filet. The steaks were prepared how we asked and had good flavor but were not special in any way. The mashed potatoes we each received with our meal were slightly warm, not hot. They had good flavor but would have been better hot. We also both received brussels sprouts. They were also good with the cheese, olive oil and salt & pepper, but I wish other options were available. For $58 a steak do I have to be locked into brussels sprouts on both plates? To drink I had a water, and my SO had a mojito. It was okay, not worth the $14. Overall, it was a good meal, but not $170 after the tip good meal. It's 5 stars at $80 and 3 stars at $170. If you want to overpay for a meal, go check this place out.

Simply awesome. I'm amazed there's only 1 review from a Yelp Elite for Brazilian Grill & Bakery. That's a shame, and a missed opportunity. Come on, Columbus, you need to go here...!I'm serious - this is my new favorite restaurant in Columbus.I guess I'm not surprised - they're located in Columbus Square, a long-aging shopping center in Northeast Columbus at the intersection of 161 and Cleveland Avenue.  The restaurant looks absolutely dumpy on the outside (see pix), then shockingly updated, light, beautiful, lively, super clean and really nice on the inside (see pix).THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS, and the price is a bargain.  Think Rodizio Grill or Texas de Brazil for half the price.  They have a 2 buffet tables (serve yourself) - one of cold items, another of hot items, and expertly grilled and seasoned meats carved for your enjoyment.  On the weekend it's $25.99/adult for all you can eat.  That's a bargain for the quality and flavors.  I hear weekdays everything is priced by the pound (I believe they said $9.99/lb for hot + cold buffet items, $15.99/lb for carved meats - still a bargain).  I did not ask the price for kids, but based on all of the families there I have to believe the price is less for kids.I was there on a Saturday afternoon and they had 5 different grilled meats - sirloin steak, beef ribs, chicken legs, chicken hearts (try one, they're tasty), and yummy sausages. All were expertly seasoned, nicely cooked, and delicious.The chimichurri sauce was absolutely world-class.  And the red sauce next to it that was ""light my fire"" hot, but full of flavor and delicious.The cold buffet items were nice, especially the potato salad.  The hot buffet items were nice, especially the rice covered with black bean stew.But the meat is why you come here. Why you'll crave here. Why my mouth is watering just writing this. Why I'm heading back soon.They also have a very nice full bar. I had a Caipirinha - it was perfect, expertly made, and delicious. The Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail - made with cachaça (a Brazilian sugar-cane rum), granulated sugar, lime, and a little mint. This was one of the best Caipirinha's I've ever had, and I've had quite a few.I asked if they could make me a Mojito, the answer was ""yes"".  Next time...The other patrons were (no surprise) mostly Brazilian families.  It's a very authentic restaurant - several servers spoke no English, and I speak no Portuguese.  The guy carving the meat spoke no English or Spanish, but hey - we made it work just fine.  That said, other servers speak perfect English and were very happy to translate when needed.I absolutely, positively felt very welcome, and the manager stopped by several times to check on me.Brazilian Grill & Bakery is a hidden Columbus gem.  If you love grilled, wonderfully seasoned meat, it's a bargain.Great place. Delicious food. Nice and friendly people. Lovely dining room. I'm getting hungry again just writing this review.  Go - just go. You'll thank me... I promise...!","Columbus, OH",105,658,3059

I'm not sure if it has changed owners but it has definitely been completely revamped.  Market side is a bit smaller, restaurant side is bigger and nicer.  Not fancy, quite, but very nice, comfy, and with a big buffet along the side.  By the pound during the week, all you can eat on weekends.  I'd been waiting to come, hoping to do the AYCE on a weekend with friends, but today it was handy.  Short line at 11am.  Tons of interesting choices, so I loaded up a plate.  Steak, sausage, macaroni salad, fried plantains, pot pie, rice, and more.  Brazilian food is different, but not strange, if that makes sense.  Homey, tasty, not generally spicy, and even if you are not adventurous you will recognize most ingredients.  But they're put together into some fantastic items.  I just skimmed the surface today and got 6 or 8 things, all were good, and if I'd had the time and appetite there were 20 more things I wanted to try.Service was friendly and helpful.  They assumed I was Brazilian (I'm not) so there was some language confusion at first.  Price was very reasonable; I think $16 for a full plate, tax, drink, and tip.  Would come right back, and will try to get here on the weekend for AYCE.  Bet it gets crazy then though.Shopped a bit on the other side, didn't get anything because I wasn't headed straight home.  But a decent small market with dry goods, snacks, frozen stuff, etc.","Columbus, OH",321,3862,1501

If not, get it in your bucket list. There is a few chain Brazilian Steakhouse around Columbus. If you are uncertain about it, I would try out from the beginner level with a more affordable option to get a feel for it. I would recommend the Brazilian Grill and Bakery. This place is just right by Mi Li Café. I has been to Mi Li multiple times and didn't even notice. The restaurant is attached with the market, and you will get to the restaurant once you walk through it.You can seat at any open table and get settle down. Once ready, just head to the buffet line and start filling your plate. They have a good mix of salad, side dishes, and some starch options. Toward the end, make sure to stay for some freshly carve meat. At the end, you will get a number tag and order your drink. Compare to a regular Brazilian Steakhouse, Brazilian Grill and Bakery offer a similar experience, just minus the meat crave at the table service. From the meat and all the side dishes, they are all perfectly delicious. All the staffs are extremely friendly and don't be afraid to ask if you have question to navigate around.On the weekend, they offer all you can eat and you can go as many round as you want. On the weekday, their buffet line item is cost by pound.","Columbus, OH",105,434,1299

Let's make this easy by starting with the restaurant side which is a buffet set up where you pay by the weight of the items you select.  You select the food you want from the hot tables and rotisserie, stop at the weigh station where they'll weigh your food.  From there, you select a table and enjoy your meal.  Want more?  Just get up and so through the line again.  The folks here speak Brazilian Portuguese as well as some decent English so there's no big language barrier.  These folks are super helpful, just ask about anything.Talking about the store side of this place, there's a small area that's stuffed full of Brazilian products.  It's probably the best use of space I've ever seen in a market!  You name it, they've got it.  In what might be 500 square feet of space, you'll find enough products to make dinner for weeks on end.  No joke.  Great snacks too!When you are done eating and shopping, just go to the check out and they'll tally up your bill all together.  You pay, you leave.You'll want to go back again soon, I'm sure.5 StarsAndYouKnowILikeValueAddedReviews...**  Brazilian food is not spicy.  If you're a mild kind of person, don't be afraid to try this cuisine out.

Love the chain link palm tree that is in the middle of the dining room.    We ordered wedge salads, a hot honey pizza and drinks.    The salads were tastey and were large for wedges - definitely had a lot of toppings which is always a plus.    The hot honey pizza came soon and we learned they make their own hot honey.  The pizza's crust was the right amount of crunch and none of the toppings were burnt.  We needed to ask for extra honey as it came to us on the light side, but getting extra homey was ""no problem""!   We both chose derive pours.   Husband had a brown english ale.   I had what is called the Pray tell , which is a blackberry/cheery sour.   I loved it!   So far derive has never let me down.   If you are thinkjng of going... just go!

They have inside and outside dining. They serve food and its not from a stupid food truck- if you cant tell,  thats a huge plus IMO.  oh and that food.... Incredible!   They have a pepperoni and hot honey pizza that IMO may be one of the best pizzas in all of Columbus.   The smash burgers are crazy good- and that comes from someone who doesn't even really like hamburgers.   I am low-key sad every time I finish the last bite.  Seriously... try this place.

I remember liking the beer, and I was hoping for good things when I chose to visit on a recent Saturday night.  Without a doubt, the place delivered. Easy parking in their lot led to easy seating at that bar for the Mrs and me. She went the cocktail route, but I was there for the beer. I had their 'Friends' flight of four beers influenced by hops from different regions. All four were on point. Definitely recommend. The menu was more robust than you would expect from a brewery, and the Thanksgiving Poutine and Loaded Fries were some of the tastiest bar carbs I've had in a while. Both were full of flavors without being too sloppy. Another pleasant surprise was the decor. Cool chandeliers, sports on TV and even a fire pit for your outdoor consumption. Derive is far from your average brewery.","Columbus, OH",16,166,917

Can't beat burger, fries, and a pint of beer for $14, especially for the quality of everything. My last review holds true, but I'll comment on the different things we tried today!The drinks were delicious! Well, I don't like Manhattans, and my partner doesn't like beer - but our drinks were delicious for who it was meant for :P I had the Mr. Tastee: Blueberry Crumble beer, which was very lightly carbonated and almost creamy. It is sour, as it's meant to be, but the cinnamon and marshmallow notes made for great sweet undertones and a warm, sweet aftertaste. The Manhattan was definitely a very strong sipper, and my partner really liked it.We were very sad to see the Kimchi burger was gone, but my partner tried the Jalapeño Popper Burger instead. We agreed it was a great concept and very yummy in some bites, but it was poorly constructed. The creamy sauce was only present on some parts, so it was very jalapeño in some bites, very popper in others. We did love the added texture of the fried onion and enjoyed the overall taste, but it'd be a lot better if more carefully made. It's not as pleasant of a spice without the sauce.Lastly, we sat inside today for the first time. It's definitely a much louder and overstimulating environment than the calmer, more intimate outdoor seating, but I suppose that's to be expected on cold day when a special is taking place. You do get checked on much more often if you sit inside. And the decor is very pretty.Can't wait to come back here and try more!","Columbus, OH",64,117,1576
"Derive Brewing","https://www.yelp.com/biz/derive-brewing-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Logan A.",5,"2023-09-07","We came here for their Wednesday night special (half price 1/3 lb burger and fries with the purchase of a full pour) and we will definitely be back! I'm not a huge burger fan, but I was really impressed by their signature Derive Burger. I think I would order the sauce on the side next time, but that's just my personal taste. I did think it would benefit from an additional topping for texture, like tomato, but it was very very flavorful. My partner tried the Korean Barbecue burger, and it was good as well! Definitely not something super Korean tasting, but it doesn't claim to be. A very unique fusion dish with ""Cleveland kimchi kraut."" And their fries!!! Perfectly salted, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. 10000% recommend their fries. The portions are generous, in my opinion. I would've been able to take home leftovers if my partner didn't have 4 stomachs.As for drinks, I'm not a huge beer person either, but I really enjoyed the stout I tried, Cheers to 3 Years. It tasted very coffee-like (Google says that's common of Stouts) but I could taste the chocolate notes too. I wished they served dessert, because this would have paired perfectly with that. Since it didn't blend super well with the taste of my food, it took me quite a while to finish this ""heavy"" beer. (Not on them though; I just don't know beer/food pairings lol.) My partner tried the Old Fashioned Chai, which we both enjoyed a lot as well. My only complaint is that my beer arrived completely wet on the bottom, which I didn't notice til I had moved it around the table, creating rings everywhere. Looked like they overfilled the glass but didn't wipe it off. We didn't get napkins til our food came either. There is lots of seating inside and outside, but our brief trip in was very warm, so we opted for the more crowded outside. Service is pretty hands-off, which isn't a bad thing, but I would've appreciated a bit more checking in, especially before we ordered since we're not very educated on beer flavors and descriptors. Drinks are out first, and food follows pretty quickly. We also waited a long time to flag down a server for water, before noticing a self-serve water dispenser hidden behind the door. It would have been very helpful for this to have been pointed out.Even if you choose to sit outside, you seat yourself and scan a QR code to start a tab. Apparently this system just started a few weeks ago. You can conveniently start the tab for just yourself, the whole table, or any combination. Just don't forget to close your tab before they close, or you'll be charged 25% gratuity automatically.Overall, this is a lively little spot to relax with good company and try unique craft beers!

My first visit last year was with my cousins, so we chose to sit at the bar for a more casual setting. The bartenders were both attentive, kind, and offered great suggestions for our entrees. They even went as far to ask about dietary restrictions and offered a dairy-free alternative for my grilled cheese, which turned out to be melt-in-your-mouth goodness.This week, I returned with the wider family to meet our friends for a pre-flight dinner. At first, I was concerned by the need to put a credit card down on a reservation - but the step-up in quality and experience is certainly a good reason why. Their menu has expanded, their popularity has seemingly multiplied, and their service has skyrocketed to the highest levels. Half of our table jumped at the Thursday night Burger Special, and everyone's patties were cooked to individual perfection from medium rare to well done.

Finally walked in the other day.  It's bigger than I expected, with a counter near the entry and a nice seating area off to the side.  I wanted one of everything from the display case: pies, cookies, etc.  I settled on a piece of chicken pot pie and a slice of maple bourbon pecan pie for there, then got a couple of other things to go.Service was minimal but very friendly and efficient.  The place is simply decorated, but very comfortable.  It would be a good place for a chat, a quiet business meetup, etc.  Kind of a hipster vibe, but still welcoming to random nerds like me.The pot pie was incredible.  Good crust, warm and tasty filling (chunks of chicken, veggies.)  Came with a fresh salad that was very simple and very good.  I had hibiscus tea with it.  I would say the portions were small, but really, the potpie slice, salad, and a slice of pie were plenty for lunch.The maple bourbon pecan pie was incredible.  Perfect crust, nice blend of flavors (though the bourbon does jump out and hit your senses.)Later on I tried the lavender chess pie, and banana bread pudding.  The bread pudding was very dense, with a nice balance of flavors.  Probably better fresh, but heated up a bit the next day it was still very good.  The lavender chess pie was incredible.  Chess pie is a sweet, custardy pie, and though I prefer its relative buttermilk pie I appreciate a good chess too.  This one was among the best I've ever had.  Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, thick and custardy, perfect crust, a hint of lemon and lavender... Just amazing.It's a little pricey for the portion size, but so worth it.

This is the sort of spot that every city should have!It was a super cool, set up with three levels, including an outdoor bar area on the roof. There were seven or eight restaurants down below, where you could grab food and either take it upstairs or eat in a common area. There were tons of TVs, playing sports and plenty of space to spread out. The service was fast and friendly, and everyone was very helpful from the woman at the door all the way to the folks upstairs at the bar.After sampling a number of the different restaurant options, we moved upstairs to the rooftop bar where all of the Adults had libations, and the kids got to spread out and play some board games. It was pretty cool! I must say that it has been quite a while since I've been somewhere where I could get good fried chicken, a lobster roll and mini cheesecakes. Also, cCuck Norris is the best restaurant name that I've come across in quite some time! After that, we moved down to the second floor where  they had ski ball, and a couple of arcade games. It is amazing how much you can spend on ski ball when you've got seven children playing in rapid succession! There were also plenty of boardgames, and some great counter height seating to hang at.Three families of friends met up here, and we spent about four hours here one afternoon. It was a great location, there was plenty to do and there was tons of great food... As previously stated, every city should have a spot like this!","Yakima, WA",1004,1923,1535

They have bar service and the one person was working hard. Not really of fan of these new food court atmospheres.

The parking looked scary but this was our third time there and we always catch someone leaving. There is also parking on the street. The second floor is kid friendly with board games for the family. We even brought our own cards and chips to play Blackjack. The atmosphere was fun and friendly. But if crowds aren't your thing, this isn't the place for you. It was extremely crowded on every level, but everyone was completely polite and understanding. They have menus with QR codes to every restaurant at the tables. It sounds convenient, but it wasn't. My family was yelling their order at me but you can only order and pay from one restaurant at a time. It took my Apple Pay, but not my husband's. He had difficulty with his credit card too, but worked it out. I recommend downloading Toast Takeout application to make it easier or the ultimate recommendation would be to go to each restaurant in person to place your order and they will text you when they are ready. We ordered from Cheesecake Girl, Cluck Norris, Pokebap, Cousin's Maine Lobster, Modern Southern Table, and my sister ordered mac and cheese from the pop up shop, The Pit BBQ Grill. We all shared our orders, but my sister and my daughter who had  sushi from Pokebap. My daughter tried to share but no one at the table ate sushi but her. Thank God because she inhaled it.The pop up restaurant, The Pit BBQ Grill, my sister said the mac and cheese was good but not enough for $5. I think she paid for the to go container, which was small for $5, but good Mac and cheese isn't cheap to make. They are there for three months and I'll be back to try the brisket and macaroni and cheese. Cluck Norris, I ordered their loaded fried that had cheese, tomatoes and jalapeño. They were good for what they were. I thought there was going to have some kind of meat sauce on it because I researched my order before going. I ordered from the wrong place. I meant to order from Alphabetical Comfort Kitchen which is affiliated with Cameron Mitchell's restaurant in someway. I also ordered their doughnut holes with caramel sauce. They were cold and that's all I'm going to say about that. My son had their buffalo chicken and also placed an order to take home.Modern Southern Table, we ordered the catfish nugget basket and gumbo. I normally do not eat catfish because I had too much as a child, but I tried it due to peer pressure. Glad I did. The breading was so delicious and the seasoning on the catfish was good too. Yes I'm one of those people who have to take things apart and try it separately. I would have been happy with the hot sauce but my son MADE me try their special sauce, which takes it to another level. The only problem was that you get a good amount (your money's worth) of nuggets with this small container of sauce that equals two ketchup packets. Then they charge you $0.50 for each 2 oz container. The sauce was good but not that special. It puts a bad taste in your mouth since they didn't give you enough for your fish. I would have ordered extra for the fries, but felt like we were being worked over. My son said the fries weren't as good as they are normally. But they were very busy, which shouldn't be an excuse because now everyone there received sub par french fries. But that catfish was on point!!! I didn't eat the gumbo. I'm having that for lunch at work tomorrow. I had their kool aid. It was definitely worth the money. Cheesecake Girl, I bought a slice for $9. I forget what flavor but was not disappointed. My husband and I killed it at home. I'm sorry I don't have pictures for you but by the time the food would reach the table, we devoured it. lol I do","Chicago, IL",218,86,3775

It was very different than my expectations; definitely still a classier vibe than most bars -- lots of people dressed up and acting professional -- but there was a strong mix of casual and loud patrons. It was actually VERY loud. And crowded. Not that I wanted to wait and didn't appreciate being able to sit immediately, but I think they'd benefit from seating people intentionally, for both crowd and noise control, as well as cleaning off tables before we sit. We were told we could sit anywhere, and the only available spots were tables with used glasses. They removed these a few minutes after we sat, but they were not wiped down beforehand or while we were there.Service on a Friday night was professional but extremely fast. We had to yell to our waiter and lean across the table to hear, and vice versa. They definitely should have had more people working and less people seated. Drinks were served decently quickly for the crowd, but our (4) cards were gone for at least 10 minutes.The drinks were very good, though a bit expensive for the taste, in my opinion. I almost ordered a shot by accident, because the shots aren't labeled as ""shots"" on the menu. Although I'd return during a happy hour, the noise and chaos of Friday night was too much for more than 3 stars, unfortunately.","Columbus, OH",16,166,1364

My friend moved out of town a while ago and was back to visit. We stopped at another place where we were told without reservations we could grab seats at the crowded bar or wait an hour.We opted to try our luck with Lincoln Social. We didn't have a reservation but we're given the option of patio seating and if there were no seats, the hostess would seat us at an available table for two. We found an empty table that wasn't cleaned off yet and sat down. Our server came by with water, wiped down the table, and got us a menu rather quickly. My friend follows a low sugar gluten free diet. She had unsweetened ice tea which wasn't on the menu so our server let us know it was going to take a little longer to get. I had the Citrus Creamsicle which very much reminded me of a creamsicle popsicle. It may be too sweet for some.We meant to order the L.S. Roll but accidentally ordered another one. It was good but not what we were expecting. We ordered the gluten free roasted chicken pizza. Either they cook the gluten free pizzas more (which was fine) or the kitchen left it in the oven just a smidge too long. The crispness gave it an extra texture so again, it was fine. It did come with an indicator that it was gluten free to help the kitchen with being aware of any cross-contamination.","Columbus, OH",117,557,1351

Upon entry, the front staff checked our IDs, including those of my parents. After getting the green light, we headed to elevator D to the 9th floor. When we arrived, we checked in for our table reservation to avoid the $25/person no-show fee. Since all of the outdoor seating was taken, we had a table with a window view of North High Street. We liked how there was no dining limit. However, after 1.5 hours, it got packed and was too loud for us.For drinks, our party included Sangria Sippers, Tikitok Famous, Lemon Coco Chef's Soda, and Spicy Citrus Mule. The Tikitok Famous consisted of Pineapple Upside-Daquiri, Echo Pineapple Rum, Chai, Vanilla, and Cherry shaken, served over the rocks in a tiki pineapple glass, and garnished with a multi-colored hibiscus. We liked how strong the drinks were.For food, most of the items were priced per piece. We started with Spinach and Artichoke Dip, which consisted of a creamy spinach and artichoke dip with a dollop of tomato spread served with sesame crusted toasted baguette crostini. We liked how the dip had real artichokes in it. There was more dip than crostinis, so we had to ask for more crostinis. In terms of sushi, we shared the L.S. Roll and Vegetable Rolls. The L.S. Roll consisted of shrimp tempura, asparagus, and cream cheese topped with beef carpaccio and wasabi tobiko. The Vegetable Roll consisted sweet potato tempura, avocado, and cream cheese. Between the two rolls, I enjoyed the Vegetable Roll more. Since all the pizzas contained oregano, we only got one pizza to share. We shared the Campari Tomato Pizza, which consisted of 10"" personal pizza topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, ripe tomato, torn basil, and fresh mozzarella. The pizza was cut into six slices, so each of us could try a slice.We enjoyed Fried Oysters, which consisted of a crispy fried oyster topped with a mustard aioli and pickled pepper relish served on a half shell. It was beautifully presented and one delicious bite.We enjoyed Oysters on the Half Shell, which was $4.50/oyster and served with cocktail sauce with horseradish, lemon, and hot sauce. The oysters were mild and briny.We enjoyed a variety of Stixes, including Mojo Shrimp Stix, Chicken Yakitori, and Scallop Rumaki. The Mojo Shrimp Stix consisted of two shrimps cooked to perfection topped with avocado tomatillo crema, tajin, and cotija cheese. It was the most flavorful Stix. Due to peanut allergy, we had the Chicken Yakitori without peanut sauce. It consisted of a skewer of cubed chicken topped with a sweet teriyaki glaze and scallion. The chicken was a bit dry. The Scallop Rumaki consisted of two bacon wrapped scallops topped with spicy aioli. The Prime Slider consisted of prime beef patty topped with cambozola and tomato jam on a toasted bun. I loved the combination of flavors and how it was juicy.If we visit again, I'd like to try their mocktails (Earl Grey Palmer and Citrus Creamsicle), cocktails (including Berry on the Lede, Social Universe, and Lincoln 75), beer (Fat Head's Bumble Berry Honey Blueberry Ale and Rhinegeist Seasonal Cidergeist),and food (including Meatballs and Barcocoa Taco).","Gaithersburg, MD",3482,3181,3204

If you come during the day before they fill up you can find your way through the building lobby, on to the elevator, up to the roof and speaking to staff in no time at all or if you come while they are at capacity find yourself feeling like you're trying to get into a club, waiting in line in the lobby or occasionally outside if it's truly packed. The ambiance is great and why you come. Very beautifully decorated/furnished, great views of the city, and decent enough music.During my latest visit, the service was slow, so we were only able to get 2 request in before happy hour ended.

Habibi grill is definitely a great addition to Columbus food scene in terms of having more Lebanese cuisine representation. I loved the vibe of the place with families chatting over food they are used to having and look forward to. Despite this, I would most likely choose another restaurant over Habibi grill for multiple reasons.As someone who is familiar with good vs low quality Middle Eastern food, I thought the food was far below average compared to those I've had in Michigan or probably most Mediterranean food places in Columbus. I ordered Beef Kofta with rice which came down to ~$20 for it. I think lack of middle eastern food competition in CBUS might justify the insane menu prices at this place. The staff were not rude but were not the most professional people. They almost yelled at me when I thought a take out that was prepared was mine and I asked them about it. The best part of the dish was the rice since the taste was so close to authentic rice, which I have not had in a while, but it was too salty I felt disappointed because I could order that rice alone and call that a happy meal if it wasn't for the overwhelming salty taste of it. The Kofta tasted like nothing. And I do mean nothing. Not even meat. Smelled like it though.I think most of the excitement around this business comes from the novelty of having Lebanese restaurant in CBUS, which I get. I do see a lot of potential in this business but they need to offer service and taste that would justify the price since I can get much better Kofta from the Mediterranean restaurants which are abundant around the city at a fraction of Habibi grill's menu prices.","Northland, Columbus, OH",151,329,1734

Parking is tricky in this area, but they do have a small lot. The prices were a bit of sticker shock ($27 for a vegetarian sampler), but when you see the portion sizes it makes more sense.  There are no ""lunch"" sizes offered here. The chicken shawarma entree was a hefty lunch portion for two of us. The hummus appetizer could easily feed 4 people - it is almost party catering size. The gentleman running the place is great. Really polite and helpful. He was expediting takeout orders when there was some confusion with the staff.  Atmosphere is very casual with self serve seating and lots of TVs. On to the food itself - shawarma was delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked. The yellow rice and pickled veggies tasted very good, but were extremely salty. The hummus and pita was a big let down. Hummus had a huge pool of oil in the center and was just way too oily to eat. The pita was just regular old bagged pita like you get at the grocery store and it was very dry. At these prices, definitely not worth it.

I had ordered the special, which was a Seared Tuna dish, it came out in a nice portion, but extremely bland, no sear on it, just cooked/gray on the outside, red in the middle.

Culinary Director Joshua Cook was the Executive Chef at Barrio, the popular Spanish tapas restaurant in German Village. He brings his exceptional knowledge of roasting meats, amongst his many talents to bear, in this tour-de-force menu at Ampersand Asian Supper Club.The menu focuses on ramen and donburi rice bowls. The saffron braised beef ramen bowl was not only perfect, but the perfect marriage of flavors from both Spanish and Japanese traditions, along with perfect ramen noodles, made this the best bowl of ramen that I've tried in the Continental US. Hands down. Period. The roast of the pork belly for the gua bao (folded lotus leaf style) buns was perfect too. It melted in your mouth. It wasn't over sauced, allowing the whole dish to really wow you in the melding of the flavors.  They have some of the most unique cocktails as well. They pair exceptionally with the food. The dining room is modern, and eclectic Asian, with a lone picture of the Beatles tucked away inconspicuously. I'll leave that ""Where's Waldo"" moment to you to find it.

Everything that we tried here was amazing. Great food starts with great ingredients. The sheer freshness of the pork belly, the mushrooms which look well sourced, and even the delicate and delicious broccolini were brought to perfection by the chef. I truly hate crab Rangoons which are usually 1% crab and 99% liquidy cream cheese. Theirs, aside from being perfectly fried, had delicious crab flavor and the savories that finally made me understand why someone could love these, other than as fat bombs. Best I've ever had!The pork buns were, likewise, off-the-hook good. Delicious pork belly balanced meat-to-fat, as if someone cares about how you experience each bite. The crispy broccolini was flash fried, but, thankfully, not buried in gloppy tempura batter. The full flavor of the vegetable emerges, and its beauty, too.The ramens were a tour-de-force, from their substantial broths that aren't so awash in fats that they lose their mouth feel, to the just-right noodles, to the appropriate quantity, and size, of vegetables and flavorants. The bar is also a star. I had the most refreshing wonderful cocktail that is being added to the menu. The dining room is exceptionally eclectic. Clean, colorful, complex.

I'm glad we got the 3 for $13 and it was delicious and perfectly flavored. The crispy calamari was very good. My only complaint is that I wish there would've been more for the huge bowl they were in. I think the white things that came with the calamari were pork rinds or something similar to them, but those were great. If they bagged those up and sold them separately, I'd definitely buy them in bulk. I ordered the shoyu ramen with confit chicken and it was excellent. I'm glad I got the shredded confit chicken instead of the breaded chicken because it just worked better with the dish. My only complaint is that most of the chicken didn't taste seasoned so I asked for additional pepper to add more flavor and spice. My partner had the Tonkotsu ramen, which of course I tried because why bring two people if you're not going to taste multiple menu items (). The pork was great and the broth was perfectly seasoned.

I went with their 2-for-$9 steam bun offering and tried the Pork Chashu and Gourmet Mushrooms. Also ordered their Pork Chashu Egg Roll. My mother when with their lunch special miso soup and Pork Chashu Rice Bowl. Both of my buns were surprisingly quite good. The buns were soft, with a slight hint of sweetness - very nice compliment. The pork chunk was a good match size-wise to the bun. The pickled onions and sesame Chile mayo were great, too. The mushroom bun was pretty good. Their ""asparagus salad"" was simply thin horizontal slices of a raw asparagus spear - not what I was hoping/picturing in my mind, but oh well. The wasabi vinaigrette was a nice choice, so all and all, tasty. The Chashu egg roll was nicely compact and didn't fall out of the wrap easily. It's small but packed full of the pork, cabbage, carrots mix. I liked the sweet chili ginger dipping sauce, it was a good accent. My mother's really liked her pork chashu rice bowl.

The restaurant is seat yourself but you do have your own server. We ordered a Thai tea and hot early gray to drink. The earl gray came in the CUTEST tea cup with a matching pot. To start we had the ginger salads, pork buns, and crab rangoons. The salads were delicious and very refreshing. The buns were good but had a lot of vinegar/acidic flavors that were a bit overpowering. The crab rangoons used real crab and were also very good but the sauce it came with was super sweet and kind of covered up the flavor of the Rangoons. For our main we had the tonkotsu and shio. The tonkotsu was a bit disappointing, the broth was good but overall everything lacked flavor. The pork belly was also very fatty and I wasn't able to finish. The shoyu egg however was super flavorful and one of the best I've ever had. My friend had the shio and gave me a piece of the octopus and it was super rubbery and not flavorful. He wasn't a big fan of his meal and ended up throwing out his leftovers. Not sure we'd visit again, but it was fun to try!","Seville, OH",83,217,1098

The bagel itself was not as fluffy as I'd like but it was still good. It was definitely overpriced as the one egg & cheese with avocado came out to $10.

It's rare that I say this regarding pretzels, but the dijon mustard was better than the beer cheese, because the latter tasted more like beer than cheese. My counterpart got the Pierogis and the sampling of it that I stole was impressive. My dish was the Chorizo Mac, and the combination of the meat, mac & cheese, and pickled onions blended well... though not spectacularly. The taproom trip was about what I thought it would be.

Let's start with the ambiance and decor. Killer. Cameron Mitchell spared no expense. From the chandeliers to the floor tiles, they nailed ""fine Italian"" in a great way. It's unbelievable that this is the same restaurant that housed G. Michael's Bistro. As you enter you'll walk down a really nice covered entrance to be greeted by the hosts. As you walk down the entry way take note to the left of the patio. Again. That was a parking lot folks! But take note of the outdoor bar that's first come, first-served and if you swing by when they open at 4 maybe you can grab a seat there and catch a game or two. Onward.We were seated for dinner at a table for 4 in the bar area toward the street in the main building. It's a bit of an awkward spot and we were a little confused by the usage of the space. It just doesn't feel quite right especially if you were at the restaurant for a more formal occasion as we were and you happened to get seated there. There is a mix of booths, a single high top (I think?) that lorded over our table, snd of course the bar itself. I think the booths make a lot of sense but the tables just kind of stunk. With the number of guests and the location of the tables we sometimes found ourselves waiting just a bit too long and honestly kind of felt like an afterthought. Now, our hosts and waiters staff were great, I just think it's the layout. Other options for seating are outside of course and also what I'd consider the main and proper dining area. On to the food and the menu which is my other 5 star to 4 star reason.The food we ordered was fantastic. It's much higher in quality and presentation than any other Cameron Mitchell restaurant that I've been to. From the house garlic bread that quickly finds its way to your table, to the burrata cheese that I can't recommend enough, to the pasta dish we had, each was cooked extremely well and tasted great and we have no complaints there whatsoever. Probably some of the best Italian food I've had, though I wouldn't consider myself an expert there. The wine list is big and bold. I really enjoyed it. They have a few cocktails and single glass pours of wine but noticeably they do not have beer! At least now that I saw. There's definitely an implied understanding that you should order a bottle of wine. I do wish that was more common but it's always hard for me to stomach spending 3x retail (which is common) for a bottle. Ohio needs to legalize bringing your own bottle... I was also disappointed in the lack of apéritif drinks. No whiskey. No port. No sherry. Hmmm. Ok.Ok back to dinner and maybe my chief complaint. The menu items are good. The menu is not. People understand tapas. They understand appetizers, salad, main, desert, etc. What I and I'm guessing many others don't understand is a menu full of items (great!), a server who discusses the nightly specials, and then the implication that you order a few items from the menu (sort-of tapas style), only to be asked ""and for dinner?""?????Well I've never been to a restaurant where one of the verbal ""tonight's specials"" isn't a main entree. It's very confusing and we felt a little taken aback by it. No blame for the server, he was great, but the flow of the menu just doesn't make sense to me. Now this could be my lack of understanding of Italian dining. If so. That's fair! But it would be nice if after being asked if we had dined here before (no) we had a little more explanation on how the menu works. This doesn't detract from the food, just the rating. If you're curious, we ordered four total items from the menu, a bottle of wine, and had some of the bread that was brought out and we were pretty full. For sharing between two people it was great and we felt like we had the perfect amount of food. Alright so if you've made it this far. Well. I'm sorry. But! Congrats as well because I'm guessing you read this review because you are considering or already have a reservation (you should get one it's busy even on Wednesday nights) and you're trying to get hyped up before you go. Good. It's a great restaurant and it's probably deserving of being a 5-star on the review. Hope you enjoy, and by the way swing by Lawbird, or The Laundry to grab a drink before heading over to Cento!","Columbus, OH",37,159,4921

Be prepared to open your wallet and you will have an amazing level of service. Can I give 10/5 stars? First off Jaime and team were ready to amaze. We started with a 4:15pm reservation because again, hard to get! Drinks are amazing, lots of variety and flavors no matter your preference. I stuck with the Manhattan. Most cocktails run $15-17 each. The bourbon selection and the ""Nocino spritz"" at the end were fantastic. Our table was adventurous and tried Mellon and prosciutto, artichoke, and Caesar salad made tableside. So delicious, crispy, and fresh. OH and their breadbasket is a stunner as well! Garlic toasts and a focaccia style bread with a tomato puree on top! Also a side of chunked cheese was great to nibble between drinks!We also met the wine steward, and he provided some great recommendations even bringing a wine sample to my friend who wasn't sure if the blend would sit well on her palette. He was a great one to poll for his favorite meal as well.Mains were SO hard to choose, as they do request everything on the order goes in at once (apps and entrees). We went with steak, saltimbocca, veal Parm, and a special - veal piccata. Check the menu or ask, many do not come with sides of pasta or veg. There is a pasta selection of the menu, many of which are handmade, and they can add proteins. As I mentioned I did veal piccata and added a pesto pasta as a share for the table. Beautiful fresh pesto and pine nuts on a lovely corkscrew pasta. Homemade? The veal was sooooo crisp without being burnt and had several artichoke hearts on top. I brought half home since the portion was so large. We all brought some of our meals home.By dessert, we were stuffed but picked up the limoncello tart. Beautiful tart shell, crisp lemony cream, tiny meringues. Just wonderful. Just a wonderful experience again 4:15pm reservation and we probably left by 8pm? So great, can't recommend Jaime more.Recommend for a special night out. I look forward to patio season when this patio space seems to rival Lindey's.","Westerville, OH",40,146,2091

Nice little bread and cheese to start with, and an artichoke heart to split.  Finished with a double espresso and the chocolate hazelnut torte, which was Devine.Our bartender/server was extremely friendly, but a little over the top.  Took him 10 minutes to get our check after I asked as he was too busy socializing with other patrons to hit the button on the register, even though he walked past it a dozen times.

Stopped in yesterday for dinner on a Sunday evening during the first week. Was blown away by the ambiance, food and service. I know people give CMR restaurants a hard time for being too commercial at times. This felt opposite. It was transportive, and took us to some of our favorite dining experiences in Italy and France. The outdoor courtyard/patio is idyllic, and features an outdoor bar and good amount of seating. The menu is on the pricier side - but I felt the food quality and experience warranted every bit of it. First off - they bread service is housemade focaccia and garlic bread that were both delicious. You know the food is going to be good when the complimentary bread is that thoughtful. We started with prosciutto and melon which lad layers of salty and sweet and savory. I didn't want this dish to end, and considered running it back 1-2 more times as dinner. The octopus is carpaccio style (very thin slices), but is sous vide. So many incredible flavors in this dish too. The oil and pistachio and olive... so much goodness in each bite.For our ""mains"", my husband and I shared the risotto, a table side caesar, and a scarpinocc (mini heavenly ravioli pillows). The risotto has a truffle oil but then features chanterelle mushrooms. The table side caesar is fresh and delicious and you can add anchovies. I don't say no to anchovies! The scarpinocc were mini ravioli filled with taleggio, but had some zest with balsamic, and I think lemon too.Only critique is that service took a while... but of course it is still the first week. We would have ordered dessert but it had already been two hours. We were relaxing and enjoy ourselves but needed to get home for something so skipped dessert this time. They looked heavenly though.2 glasses of wine, two apps, two pastas and a caesar came out to $172. So definitely more of an occasion spot, but if it's anything like what we experienced, you will have an amazing and magical meal. John and Haley were both incredible and so kind!","Columbus, OH",453,412,2120

We arrived and entered to find that the main part of the restaurant was about 10 tables in a small house. We were taken out around to the back patio which was totally covered for the winter months and heated in. The waitress came over after about 5 minutes and we ordered water and a bottle of wine. We got arancini to start, which were very good but nothing that made it stand out from other arancinis I have had. For our mains, I got the ricotta gnocchi. This was very good, but the star of the show was the vegetables instead of the gnocchi. The gnocchi lacked flavor and I found it okay. The vegetables were amazing and saved the dish for me. My boyfriend liked his food also. It was very expensive, and I have heard so much about this restaurant. I was slightly let down, but I don't know why. My expectations were probably too high.

Basi is definitely my go-to for either.It's teeeeeny tiny on the inside, with a larger patio, so I'd call this a summer restaurant in a lot of ways... though the first couple of times I went, we sat at the corner in the bar because we couldn't get a table. It's dimly lit and comfortable inside, and the service feels upscale and attentive. The hosts greet each guest immediately and take you to your table.I have sat on the outer edge of the patio a couple of times, and my server has been Whitney both times. I am terrible with names, but I remember hers because she is a great server.I've tried the caesar salad, the beet salad, the mussels, the eggplant, the scallops, and the other night tried the salmon with mashed potatoes and shrimp scampi special. The summer scallop dish was wrapped with bacon and served over a mix of strawberries and parsnip puree. Inventive! All dishes I have tried are delicious. My friend is still talking about the eggplant parm and how perfect it was and we tried it probably 2 months ago.The drink menu is limited, but they do it well. The old fashioned is classicly perfect and the blood orange margarita they have had on special this summer is excellent. But it's really a good spot for a wine pairing with your meal, instead.It's casual-chic and somewhat pricey, but you'll leave with that ""I just ate a meal in a quaint town in the mediterranean"" feeling.

This is a family owned restaurant that has been in its exact location for 138 years. It is obvious by the structure of the restaurant, and the rustic interior that it's been here for a long time!

We were lucky we found some open spots at the bar. Lorenzo was the bartender. He chatted with us about Schmidt's, and about how much he loves working there. He's meet so many people from all over the world, while making drinks.We got some beers and and a sampler of four of their famous sausages. We also got three sides. At the bar where we were sitting there was an old wooden door, Lorenzo said it's the fridge door. It kept opening and closing on its own. All of us were coming up with funny stories about who's behind the door.Needles to say we picked a great spot, for a great view of the place and a spot to talk to Lorenzo the bartender.Our food arrived and each of the sausages was graciously cut in half, so we could share our meal between the three of us.I couldn't really say which sausage was which, or which one was my favorite, but they were all juicy and flavorful! We also enjoyed the sides, the German sweet slaw, reminded me alot of my mom's, the green beans and the waffle fries! Everything was very tasty! They also have some of the largest cream puffs I have ever seen in my life. We didn't get any dessert here, because we got some chocolate at their Fudge Haus.This place is so much fun! From the music, to the waitstaff, to the delicious food and drinks, I would for sure stop by here again if life led me to Columbus.","Columbus, OH",1,61,1777

The tastes they create are exquisite, they have good GF / DF / SF awareness, and the service and ambience are excellent. The word 'organic' is in the name, so surely they wouldn't use industrial seed oils that are manufactured using chemical solvents such as hexane... right? I didn't even ask until I'd dined here maybe a dozen times. The waiter told me about a special that sounded nice, and I asked (out of an abundance of caution) whether it contained canola oil... Health-aware diners should be warned that this establishment uses a canola/olive oil blend as their primary oil for cooking, AND IN DRESSINGS. The former is regrettable, but the latter is inexplicable. They use industrial seed oils in *everything*. And it isn't even organic, as the name of the restaurant would suggest. I had a long email exchange with Louis, who btw seems like a very nice person. They said they use the industrial seed oil blend as their primary oil to reduce expenses, and in some cases (such as in the beet salad) because of its neutral flavor. While I do understand the need to keep costs low, and while the tastes they create are truly remarkable, it's false advertising to put the word organic in the name of your restaurant and then to use an industrially-processed seed oil that's made using chemical solvents as your primary oil. And to put it in dressings??I know some folks who aren't turned on to the dangers of industrial oils in food will downrank this review. That's fine. This place is a healthier choice than most. I'm just here to warn the folks who do avoid seed oils, because they're not disclosed on the menu and the marketing and ambience of this place would generally lead one to assume they aren't in the picture.--Update 1/30/24: When I wrote this, I was waiting to hear back from Louis about whether the canola oil they use is organic, and about their procedures for making dishes without seed oils upon request. They responded after seeing this review, and I think they took it personally (I'm sorry... I recognize that this establishment has a lot going for it, and I believe my review is quite fair). Anyway... they flatly refused to answer either question. So, we should unfortunately assume that the seed oil they use is not organic and therefore does likely contain traces of chemical solvents such as hexane, since that is how non-organic canola oil is typically manufactured.  The last time I dined here, the waiter told me the dish I'd ordered didn't contain canola oil.  Based on these emails with Louis, I've come to understand that this was not true.  Therefore, I think it's only fair that I warn folks: the staff is perhaps not (currently) adequately trained on this aspect of things, which is a shame because they are relatively good about gluten, dairy, etc. (they served me something to which I was allergic on a different occasion, but they quickly realized the mistake and came back out to let me know, to retrieve the dish, and to make amends, so I wasn't going to mention that).  I will update this review if Louis responds with more info. Louis, this isn't personal. Thank you for creating a high quality restaurant with delicious food, good service, and relatively healthy options. I'm just looking out for folks who are specifically concerned about seed oils, since it's not something you or your staff is well versed in.  I will update this review if anything changes or if anything I've said turns out to be incorrect.","Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA",330,13,3505

PARKING:Average-sized small-ish parking lot, but definitely ample space to accommodate the businesses in the plaza.WHAT WE ORDERED:* Mazesoba ramen with chicken chashu and miso soup (you get to choose between minced pork and chicken chashu, and between miso soup and green salad as a side)* Karaage ramen* Spicy tonkotsu ramen* Kyushu classic tonkotsu ramenFOOD:First of all, portion sizes were great! At least compared to a lot of places I've had back home. The mazesoba ramen was drizzled with a sweet and savory sauce which made the noodles super addicting. The chashu, even though it was chicken, was nice and juicy. Miso soup on the side was a nice touch for some moisture in between bites of noodle. The tonkotsu ramens were topped with an ample amount of toppings, and both broths were delicious. For my taste, the spicy tonkotsu wasn't that spicy, but depends on your spice tolerance. But the star of the show: the karaage ramen! I've never seen this at other ramen places, but the karaage was light and crispy, and very juicy and fatty inside - so delicious by itself, but complemented by the carbs and warm broth. This is a must order for me.SERVICE:Servers were very willing to help explain menu items, and very attentive. Food came out SUPER fast!VIBES:It wasn't too busy when we went despite going during a festival weekend, and there were ample tables big enough to fit catch-ups with friends or a casual night out for dinner with family.BOTTOM LINE:Go here.","Garden Grove, CA",441,73,1586

I am not a ramen fan, but that's never stopped me from trying other things on menus. The interior space is quite small: decent sushi bar seating and a single row of four-top tables opposite the counter. It's nice to watch them cooking, but beware the bar stools are aren't the comfiest. I tried the Chachu Buns, Karaage Buns, and a soft boiled egg side for more protein. The chachu buns were delicious. The pork belly slice is quite thin, so be prepared. Really liked their special sauce. The bun was a big plus, considering the last few places I've tried buns have had no taste, too sweet, or too hard. The flavor profile of that starter was a top choice. Just wish there was a second very tasty slice of the pork belly. Same delish nod goes for the Karaage Buns - warm, juicy Japanese-style fried chicken, the same sauce, just wish the chicken piece was a bit bigger; the flavors were also spot on. I forgot to take a picture, so use your imagination; or look at the other photos :D in case your wondering, their spicy mayo is not hot at all, didn't overwhelm, a great supporting role.I don't know how to do a soft egg Japanese style. Is it soft boiled first, then preserved in a liquid? Whatever, it was the perfect side. I love that the Japanese take on this side does not involve vinegar, salt, sugar, etc. for pickling. My meal was wonderful! I love how Kyushu is on the casual side, and their food is a strong highlight! For $16, quality and price were comparable.

Don't get me wrong. It's a very good burger. But I remember when they were just starting out, using temporary space in other bars and restaurants. Back then the burger (the actual patty) was AMAZING. I talked to the cook (may have been the owner) and heard all about the special beef blend and how they cooked it. It was thin, a little crunchy, and just amazing.Now it's just a good burger. I don't know if they changed the recipe or some of the cooks didn't get the memo on how to cook them. I had one today expecting world-shattering burger greatness like a few years ago. It was really good but not much different from a good burger you could get anywhere else.Back then I told so many people they had to have a Preston's cheese burger because it was LITERALLY the best burger I'd had on 5 continents.

We were trying to find a happy hour on a Friday night at 5. It was difficult finding a restaurant with open seats at the bar! I had read the GH does HH, but they don't have a menu online. We went in and asked the hostess. She told us they do half off apps and shareables, house cocktails, and wine pours. Good deal! AND it's throughout the whole restaurant. We were seated quickly. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and very aesthetic! Our waitress seemed kind of annoyed to be serving us. We had to ask about happy hour as at no time did she mention in. At times she was fine, but then would also come off as rude and interrupt us before we were done asking questions. We ordered the HH oysters. She asked us if we wanted 3 or 4. That wasn't listed on the menu, so while my boyfriend was in the process of asking which was apart of the happy hour she interrupted and said ""3."" I mean , she knew what we were asking but at least let us speak! It hadnt bothered me until we tried to put a drink order in before the HH ended and I ordered and she walked away before taking my boyfriends order. We had to awkwardly call her back. It just seemed like she didn't want to serve us, or she wasn't interested in helping us with their happy hour. The food was fine. The brussel sprouts were average. The oysters were good. The waygu app was bland and a weird cut of meat. We initially ordered it rare, but were told the chef recommends its medium or else it's tough. We settled for medium rare and I will agree that the chef was right, it was very hard to cut. But we were also never offered steak knives and couldn't catch our waitress to ask for them. The steak was lacking seasoning or flavor. The mushrooms and onions below were more for presentation and not flavor. I would skip on this dish. I would come back to the guild house, but I think only if who I was with had requested it.

Nothing makes the miles while away, like discussing what's for dinner for 3 hours.This is basically what happened as we drove from Baltimore to Columbus. Getting four individuals with specific tastes to agree is quite the chore, but when Pierogies were put on the table, not much argument against that could be said. The Good:*Interesting place that's really a dive bar that just happens to serve some tasty Polish comfort food. *Featured in Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (S27:E9 ""College Champs""), if that floats your boat. It doesn't float mine, but you do you. *Tons of local microbrews and ciders on-tap. *Outdoor dining *Great value for the money, but I'm from Cali, so take that with a grain of salt. *Mushroom Stroganoff was very comfort food good. Nothing that'll blow your socks off but tasty.*Pierogies were all tasty (just depends on what you like), and they have something for every diet, even vegans. *Crispy potato Latkes were good and crisp (as advertised) but could've used some salt. The Meh:*Fried Sauerkraut balls were crisp but had no real flavor. It needed a dipping sauce or something. *Pet peeve of mine is when restaurants call something ""poutine,"" when it's actually just cheddar cheese fries... No curds = no poutine. The Ugly:*We didn't feel the most welcome there, and I'm sure we're not their typical crowd, but we were definitely harshing their mellow.

We had an assortment of pierogis (of course) and the chicken paprikas, which was filled with warmth and flavor and rich dumplings. The food comes out quickly too.This is a place I'd love to come with friends for an extended stay, alternating between food and beer offerings.

We went to celebrate a day before Valentine's Day so giving the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were just not on top of it due to being busy? It took a long time just for the table to get our bottle of wine, our server was very friendly but slooooow. Went at her own pace, we were at the restaurant for over 2 hours. Again not a huge deal we were there celebrating with 6 of us but still have never been there that long. My husbands steak came out over done, but he didn't say anything about it because it wasn't super over. My brother in laws steak was supposed to be rare & it came out looking burnt and completely cooked on the inside, so of course he sent it back because where you're paying $70+ for a steak you want it to be correct. It took a while for him to get his steak back after we were already all eating. I got the seared salmon, it really lacked flavor and again was just over done. Mashed potatoes were pretty good. Everyone elses food was good. But definitely did not live up to the normal Jeff Ruby's expectation.Butter cake for dessert as always was amazing.","OH, OH",5,59,1234

We celebrated our 7th anniversary and man were we hungry!We started with 3 appetizers (I mentioned we were hungry, right?) crab cake, scallops and oysters. Crab cake--my goodness, incredible! Perfect balance of letting the crab shine while also brining something interesting to the table. 9/10. The scallops--again, divine. My ONLY critique, there were only two we needed about 100. 10/10. We finished with the oysters--good taste, but we both fought through broken shell most of the time. 6/10. For dinner, I ordered the pork chop, medium cook. When it arrived, I was pleased to see the medium cook was perfect. However, unfortunately, it was completely dry. Not sure which part of the cooking method led to this, but it had lost all moisture despite being cooked medium. The saving--the caper sauce, 10/10. At this point, I just fought through it because the sauce was undeniable, the pork chop became simply a vehicle to consume more of the caper sauce. 6/10My wife ordered the apricot Burrata salad, she indicated that there was no crunch element (i.e., croutons, etc). With the Burrata it was basically soft on soft. 6/10. Drink time! The wife ordered the Apple Blondie, very delicious 8/10--I kept it classy with the Manhattan and it didn't disappoint 8/10Overall, great experience definitely recommend the appetizer menu!","Columbus, OH",428,49,1437

We ordered the wine and nobody came by to take our food order for (not exaggerating) another 45 mins. We were seated in a back corner, but you'd think they'd come by soon after taking drink orders?

I tried their $30 deal and ordered the Tavern pretzels, short rib dinner and chocolate cake. My partner ordered the maple burger. Overall this whole experience was okay, but we both agreed we wanted more and this experience was not worth $30 per person. The only thing I'd go back for is the Tavern pretzels! They were easily a 5/5 and absolutely delicious.The vibe is family friendly and laidback. Yes people were drinking, but it's the vibe at least during normal dinner time where people keep to themselves and nothing crazy is going on. We saw lots of families, couples and groups of friends hanging out.The service was good. The waitress refilled our waters and made sure we knew when food was about to come out. Now to talk about the three dishes. The short rib was okay. The mashed potatoes tasted home made, the meat was tender and the veggies were a little undercooked. The flavor was a bit dull and the meal overall just tasted like something you could eat at someone's house. It wasn't bad, but just not great. The maple burger was similar except the burger was a little dry, skimpy on the bacon and the fries were really greasy. Typical bar food, but not something I'd crave when I'm not drinking. Lastly the chocolate cake was good. It's from joyful baked goods that specializes in gluten free baked goods Overall, I just wasn't too impressed and don't plan on going back.

We were both upsold to the ""regular"" size versions of the entrees from the ""minis"" by the nice lady behind the counter... and we were good with it. Both entrees provided enough food to be full without yielding leftovers. Taste-wise, the gravy *made* the Loco Moto. It saturated the beef patties and the rice underneath, which is a very good thing because the eggs and rice don't add much in the flavor department. The macaroni salad that comes with the dishes is a notable upgrade to the rice, but it's unfortunate that you only get one scoop. The Pork and Cabbage dish had a pleasant flavor, but it could have used some gravy/jus/marinade to moisturize the dish. There's a lot more to explore on the menu.

Warios Beef and Pork happens to be both. But let's go ahead and throw in the word ""exceptional"". The cold cut is an absolute masterpiece. The ingredients list for this sandwich feels like a paragraph read....Rosemary ham, soppresseta, hot coppa, picante provolone, giadiniera, wario sauce, tomato butter, lettuce and onions, and finally the seeded roll. It's a behemoth of a sandwich, and as busy as I have ever seen. My initial skepticism on whether so many ingredients can work together is completely wiped out after one bite. Even the seeded bread, which I am not a usual fan of, hits the spot. The tomato butter takes the whole thing to a new level. I've had a cold cut in at least 20 states across the country. Warios easily is top 2. It's that good!","Boca Raton, FL",975,684,814

I shared this and couldn't even finish my half. The house spuds are also delicious, and a huge portion. Neither of us could finish them! So, for $25 for two people, I wouldn't say this place is really all that expensive. The chicken cutlets were super crispy and fresh, and the broccoli rabe was excellent.

So we said yes to the experience of Star Kitchen. Let me start out: this place is well managed and the food is a very good value.   You get a lot for your money.   The staff has the energy that makes you feel they really care about the place, food  and their service.  It is clean: dining room, kitchen, bathroom. Staff was friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable.     You order from an overhead menu at the counter (much like a McDonalds) but after you order they bring it out to you.  We ordered a Marion Village and a Chicken Little w/fries. Omg.  The fries are the star of the show.    Yum.  You want fries that have a little bit of crisp to them, but aren't over cooked or burnt.... Go here!   They even have a drive thru.  If you like salt you need to ask for it.  They come without and honestly don't need it.  That good!!!! The Marion Village is essentially their take on a gyro.  It had grilled peppers/onions which trad gyros dont have.  Lots of feta.  The meat was generous, tender, not dry at all.  The tomatoes were fresh.  It had a sauce but it was not Taziki, not sure what it was but it was okay.  Like I said,  its their take on a gyro. I got the Chicken Little... solely because it was grilled chicken.  That is a regular sized wrap with chicken, iceburg lettuce, cheese and dressing.  The cheese was a liquid whiz type of cheese.  I did not enjoy that element.  I found the chicken not to be seasoned.  For me the sandwich flavor didn't work.   However every element was fresh it was merely personal preference that I didn't like the menu item.  I saved half of it and when I get home will put franks wing sauce on it and I bet I love it.  I should of ordered the Marion Village with chicken vs gyro meat.  Imo, that would be the perfect sammy there.","New Albany, OH",66,203,1983

Plenty of parking designed solely for the Service Bar which made it very convenient. There was an odd smell but it's likely due to the MidWest Spirits being produced in there. You get used to it. The service was fantastic. We started with the French fries and the wings. Both of them were great. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table. My BILs got the espresso martinis. They were a bit underwhelmed by the size but enjoyed them. They would have preferred them without bitters but they didn't have any problem enjoying them.

This was a totally diff experience from last time I visited about a year ago. Next time anyone asks for a more upscale yet unpretentious dinner, this on my short list of recommendations. I love the ambiance... moody and vibey and elevated. The bar is a work of art in and of itself. The food is beautiful yet totally comforting. Elevated Midwest food with Italian inspiration. My favorite.  The Duck Confit Gnudi blew me away and so did the Lamb Shank. Those are must orders. Pappardelle is my go-to Italian dish and this one was excellent. Handmade pasta that had the perfect texture. My friend Rosalie and I had a full-blown conversation about the noodles being ""QQ"" - a term originating from Taiwan that is basically the Asian version of ""al dente."" Soft, chewy and bouncy - but not mushy. These noodles were QQ.  For starters, both the Lake Erie Rillettes (walleye) and Porchetta & Burrata Toast are worth trying and great for sharing.  Cocktails are gorgeous and tasty - all using Middle West Spirits. We both loved the Oaxacan 75. Such a fun take on a French 75 with much more flavor and spice and complexity.

The Caesar Salad consisted of gem lettuce tossed in a creamy caesar dressing with  rosemary-garlic croutons and shredded parmigiano reggiano. The Tempura Squash Blossoms consisted of three tempura-battered squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese garnished with pickled carrots, served with charred shishito peppers garnished with pickled red onions, and pepper jelly similar to a sweet Thai chili dipping sauce. The 1/2 Dozen Oysters On the Half Shell was served with a strawberry and shallot mignonette.For dinner, we shared a combination of lite fare and entrees - Pappadelle, Hearth Roasted Cauliflower, Adobo Marinated Pork Shank, and Middle West Burger. The Palladelle was tossed in a ragu bolognese and garnished with grated Pecorino cheese. The dish was a bit on the salty side. I was surprised that the Pappadelle was considered an entree. The portion was kind of small. The Hearth Roasted Cauliflower consisted of dill roasted cauliflower served over spiced black lentil, onions, and pomegranate with whipped labneh, and garnished with toasted breadcrumbs. The Adobo Marinated Pork Shank was served in a Guajillo Chile sauce with cilantro rice. The pork shank was well cooked, tender, and fell off the bone. The Middle West Burger consisted of a beef patty made from Creekstone Farms Beef, house pickles, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli on a toasted brioche bun.

The restaurant itself was kinda hard to find because it is hidden in the back of some buildings and I felt like I was in the wrong place when I arrived. I have seen this distillery brand all around Columbus, but have yet to be able to go to this restaurant because I did not realize it existed. Definitely must check out if you love their brand. My friends, and I seated in the way back where I couldn't find them, but once told the lady in the shop, she was able to help me find my friends. Our waiter knew exactly what we wanted to order by offering suggestions that fit a larger group. I highly recommend the Crispy Tempura Cauliflower. The Watershed Distillery Bourbon ginger glaze,cilantro, sesame made the cauliflower something to crave. We also got the following appetizers as well but none were as amazing as the cauliflower. We enjoyed the fried Brussel sprouts, homemade bread and spread and the crispy fingerling potatoes. If you're going to get an appetizers my top two were cauliflower and the potatoes. My drink however was not my favorite. I got the Piri Piri Spritz in the Africa section. This cocktail came with Rosé wine, Cocchi Americano Bianco, Sour Piri Piri Plum Shrub, Lemon sorbet, and Prosecco. The drink was mixed perfectly, but it was way too sweet and reminded me of manischewitz. Please let me know if you get that reference.

They have sushi, bibimbap, noodles and various other small plates. They even have $1 popsicles! First walking up, the menu on the board and what is taped to the counter don't match - so that was a little confusing. I ended up going for the bulgogi rice bowl. This was delicious and filling. After I ordered and was waiting, I saw someone's number get called and take a brunch sandwich... and it looked insanely good. I had a little bit of regret but I will definitely try that next time (although looks like a special sandwich each weekend). It also looks like they and some banchan in their fridge for sale.

It was really easy! I got it for pick up and was told it would be ready in 10-12 minutes, wowza! That was fast. I immediately hopped in my car and found my way there. I didn't end up parking, just threw my flashers on in the alley in front of the restaurant and ran in. They asked to see my confirmation email and then handed me my piping hot food. The ride home I was practically drooling from how good it smelled. Once I got home I dove right in. The paella was obviously the star of the show. Rice, beans, corn, sauteed peppers, and those plantains on top were amazing! It wasn't too spicy but backed a punch after every bite. I can't wait to order it again.

Came on a weekday morning, no wait.  It is tiny, and there is no room to wait, so be prepared especially in bad weather.  Looks like they have a tablet to check in at busy times.  Cozy, comfy inside.  Great service.  Interesting menu, though I hate the QR code thing.  Luckily, one of our phones had enough signal, and we picked what we wanted but actually gave our order to the server.  Good coffee.  Sweetie got cheesy hash browns and was completely underwhelmed.  She had wanted pancakes, but none on the menu.  The hash browns looked fine but had no flavor and were swimming in- grease?  Something that didn't belong there.  She barely ate any.  I tried a bite after she shoved it away and, yeah, blah.  Big portion, but no one was interested.I had to get goetta because I like it and have made it.  And it was excellent.  One piece a tad overcooked, but still okay.  Tiny tiny portion though.  I also ordered a Swedish sausage, thinking I would have plenty to take home, but after the goetta I was still pretty hungry.  Polished it off too.  It was reasonably sized, and an excellent, subtle but savory, sausage.  Either meat with a couple of eggs would be a decent but still fairly small breakfast.Expensive, but the quality is up there, at least for some items.

We finally gave it a go, and had heard that there is usually a wait because the inside is rather small. Well, that is a bit of an understatement -- the inside is very crammed, and there's only about 5 tables. They do have a tiny bar area, but they weren't letting any parties sit there. The wait time was only about 25 minutes when we went. They don't take call aheads or reservations -- just check in on an iPad when you arrive to join the waitlist. They have a rotating menu, and it's quite small -- not like your typical brunch place. They don't have physical menus, so make sure your phone is charged so you can scan the QR code. The online menu is a little goofy on the phone browser because you have to click on each item to read the description, then go back to the home page and select again. The prices are also quite a bit higher than you'll find at most places, which fits with the niche farm to table theme. But $5 for a simple cup of coffee? Hmmm. I guess they have to make up for only being open 3 days a week.We started with cheese blintz for the table -- crepes filled with sheep's milk ricotta and crème Anglaise, topped with blackberries. These were the (only) star of the show and definitely would recommend trying them. My SO tried the biscuits & gravy, touted on the menu as blackened chicken breasts in a peppery veloute over a griddled ""cat's head"" biscuit  topped with scrambled eggs. I'm not sure if it was the veloute or what, but the chicken looked like it came straight from a can and should be served to a cat -- maybe that's how they decided on the ""cat's head"" biscuit? Do not recommend.I tried the farmhouse ranch cheese burger. It's comes with what appeared to be Lay's kettle chips. The ranch cheese was actually really good, but otherwise the burger was average and not worth the $23 price tag. The others at the table both got the breakfast sando, which had scrambled eggs and cheddar on griddled hot cross buns with a maple mustard. Want to add bacon? You can get 3 slices for $10. The service was a bit lackluster, which I didn't quite understand since they serve so few patrons at a given time. For example, we ordered coffees and had cream and sugar. We had no silverware or anything to mix the coffee with. Eventually, we asked for silverware but they didn't bring it out until we got our meals. Also, it was just all around slow. Lastly, the claustrophobic box of a restaurant had such poor air flow and it was so hot that everyone at our table was sweating by the time we got our food. In fact, it actually felt better outside the restaurant than inside. Overall, pretty disappointing experience at Skillet and definitely won't be back. The only thing salvaging this from a 1 star review are the cheese blintz, which I would get again in a heartbeat, but seeing as we won't be back, that doesn't really matter.","Clarksville, TN",21,83,2927

When coming here, be prepared to park on the street or at another business, as the entrance to this parking lot seems to be super hidden.This put me off to start, but I was pleased with how fast our food came after we ordered. At this restaurant, you order at the counter and they bring your food to you. My friends and I did not wait very long for our meals.I got the award winning breakfast tacos, and I hate to say, I don't see how they're award winning. They looked very pretty, but I found that there wasn't much flavor in them. They did not satisfy my taco craving nor my breakfast craving.The redeeming parts of the meal were the Mexican corn that came as a side with the tacos, and the pancake balls. The corn was fresh, nicely seasoned, and tasted wonderful. The pancake balls came out warm and stuffed with melty, gooey Nutella. They were so soft, not very sweet, and just comforting to eat. The bacon that comes with the balls should also not be ignored as it provides a salty balance to the meal.Like I said before, I was overall disappointed with my lunch at this place. I expected my tacos to have more flavor (as they are claimed to be award winning), and it's very expensive for the portion sizes.

I heard this place was great but small portion's, potato ""hash"" is just potato's, everything was served cold. Good bacon but my plate was 80 percent toast. Too much bread and not enough protein. They could benefit by putting jam on the tables for the toast. Also very over priced for what it is.

The food quality does not change doing a to-go order versus eating at the restaurant which is something that I can't say for a lot of other places. And the pick up window by the counter makes it quick and easy to get in and out.I ordered my usual, which is the half nutella and half dulce de leche pancake balls, as well as the huge mazatlan sunrise sammie. I was a little bummed by this recent order of pancake balls as the filling was lacking as compared to past orders, and the quantity seemed to be off by a couple where I feel like I received less than normal. However, the sammie hit the spot. The roasted red peppers are what make the sandwich. The bread is so nice and toasty and it holds everything together well.Overall I always end up with a satisfying meal, but it's a little pricey so I don't eat here as often as I'd like.","Columbus, OH",6,70,914

It made for a great tasting sandwich. On to the main attraction, the balls. They were cooked perfectly and each of the fillings provided a phenomenal bite and dipping them in the maple syrup just put it over the top.

We came here with a group of 5 of us around 1030 on a Saturday and it was pretty packed. Thankfully the weather was decent enough for us to sit outside on their patio. Both locations have always been busy in my experience. The decor and atmosphere is very lively and fun. I love getting the breakfast tacos here and the pancake balls with their vegetarian sausage.

An added bonus is the Asian eatery next door. You have the privilege to order off their menu as well. We enjoyed appetizers of potstickers and sushi. Delicious. Entree's we're done equally as well.

Been visiting mom a lot lately so am enjoying getting to know the city again. Lots of hip places these days, like Soth Village Grille.On the hunt for a really good Burger, I searched reviews here and online. I settled on Soth Village because it wasn't too far and they sold me on the House Burger with its short rib grind, pepper jam, and brioche bun. Salivating, I called my order in and jumped in my car to go pick it up. It was ready before I got there. Upon walking in, I was reminded of NYC dining (where I live now). The place is dimly lit, nicely appointed, and quite small. The prices are akin to NYC too, as my Burger was $19. Or $21 since I got the truffle fries. The Burger was cooked just right and rightly sized. It was tender and moist and the toppings were crisp and fresh, the bun soft and light and toasty--great contrast of textures. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the flavor,  which to me was bland. The meat was unseasoned and I didn't taste the pepper jam. The fries were decent but not quite crispy, but the truffle mayo hit the spot. I'm split between a 3 and a 4 here because I was really looking for a great Burger and that first bite left me unsatisfied on the flavor front. I'll go 4 since clearly the food is high quality nonetheless and otherwise.","New York, NY",163,139,1389

Wanted to update my review, as Anna and I stopped in for Sunday brunch after checking out the German Village Makers Market's Apple Fest vender event down the way. Their Village Farmhouse Salad (with salmon) base is kale, not a personal favorite, but this was well done: the kale was nicely massaged enough to soften the leaves; tossed in their champagne vinaigrette dressing, a great compliment to the flavors, was perfect. Really shows that the kitchen is taking the extra step to make sure their quality-to-quantity (price) ratio is spot on. I do wish my salmon was cooked a minute or two less to leave it even softer to chew, but the medium-doneness was still decent.","Columbus, OH",897,1884,752

Our waitress, Ryan, SHE did a fantastic job. We were never rushed, offered her favs on the menu, happy to explain the dishes with more detail. We decided to try a few things and share. Started with the Beet & Goat Cheese Terrine. It was so colorful! The yellow beets-and-goat cheese pinwheels were adorable, not to mention flavorful and filling. The lemon vinaigrette has a tart, so beware if you don't like a little tart in your life. We picked the Salmon entree and their Steak Special (which is determined by the chef) of NY Strip Steak. The salmon came on a spread of hummus which wasn't my favorite. I love hummus, but something wasn't reeling me in. The Lebanese Salata had too much lemon taste. It's wasn't horrible, but I couldn't finish it due to the pucker power. I did try a bite of the strip steak. Well seasoned and juicy. Really, simply one small bummer, well I guess really it's a personal preference: Softer shortbread biscuits for their Strawberry Shortcake dessert. In hind sight, I really can't knock them on their choice of shortbread. Here, they use a crunchy, crispy biscuit, which I'm not a fan of (soft and moist all the way!). However, the fresh strawberry sauce, ice cream and (I'm assuming homemade) whipped cream where all on point! Yes, like most have stated, this new restaurant is a keeper.

I saw that there was burnt cauliflower as a vegetarian option but I don't like smoky food I got the large fries instead. The fries were crispy, well seasoned and the sauce was the best part!! I would go back just for that alone. They had outdoor seating right behind the food truck and if you wanted a drink you could go inside to order one. The prices/drinks were posted on the window by the seating . I also ordered the small mac and cheese to try. I was personally not a huge fan, it was almost like the texture of Easy mac and wish it had more of a thicker cheese sauce texture (not pictured). I personally recommend ordering the fries over the mac!My friends shared meat sweats. They said everything was great but the ribs were their least favorite. It came with three different sauces but they loved the sauce with my fries more and kept digging into that. The man at the register was very friendly and always had a smile on his face while serving his customers! :) If you're looking for your food to come out fast, a sandwich is the way to go!

Can't stand a place that will NOT seat you til everyone in your party arrives  The server was very nice and prompt, I did not get her name (forgot my receipt and cannot remember if she told us when coming to our table initially) Me and another person in our party ordered the Thit Kho Thom Hash, with a fried hard egg. Unfortunately  we sent the food back, it was way too syrupy and sweet. The menu did say there was syrup, but we didn't think the syrup would over power the dish, hash is usually savory. I ordered the Breakfast Burger as a replacement (delicious) and friend ordered a Brussels' sprouts and sausage. There a few up charges on the receipt- .50 each for tomato/onion/pickles I asked for with the breakfast sandwich and as well if one pays with a credit card they pass the 3% surcharge on to you.

We go for brunch and do bottomless mimosas and right from the get go the guy tells us, well if im not busy I can do separate checks. It was us and 2 other tables on the entire restaurant. Then proceeds to tell us when we order the bottomless mimosas that there's a two hour cap. And after our first order, takes 30 minutes to bring the first drink. So we start the timer then. And later on he tries to say we're at our 2 hr max and we show him the clock. Now at that point, he was on board with what we were saying. But how ridiculous for a place to be such sticklers about that when you're paying 30$pp for these bottomless drinks. I could see if people aren't eating anymore or just order that and sit there. But if they're there to spend money on all of it, and aren't sitting around for an excessively long time, I don't see a reason to track it down to the minute.

Great Happy Hour!! Parking can also be a bit challenging in the Short North.  The suburb location you don't have to worry about either so much, they usually always have a table available, sometimes a wait depending and parking is ample! The suburb location is off a main road and in a strip mall parking lot so you have plenty of parking!The food is really good no matter what you get!

It was between this and the truffley ravioli. The individual gnocchi kinda globes together to make giant ones that i had to cut apart with my fork which wasn't horrible, but still a bit blobby. Also the sauce was kind of plain tomato with shredded lamb, which didn't give me quite the texture I was hoping for against the chewy gnocchi. The portion size was big so that was nice.

Thanks to fellow Yelpers, I found Marcella's which seemed to offer great food at reasonable prices in a somewhat casual atmosphere. I decided it would be perfect for myself and my colleagues.  It was a 10-minute walk from our hotel.  Considering it was 30° outside, we bundled up and headed out.  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and shown to a table near the back of the restaurant.  The lighting, decor and abundance of wood throughout the room made it feel very welcoming and the tables of customers chatting and socializing gave it a wonderful ambiance.We chose to order cocktails and an appetizer of arancini.  My Old Fashioned was well made and nicely balanced. But it was the arancini that kicked the night off on the right foot.  The were nicely sized and crispy on the outside, dusted with parsley and parmesan cheese.  Once you bit into the crunchy exterior you were greeted with soft, flavorful rice enveloped in cheesy goodness.  They were served with a side of classic marinara and we all debated whether it enhanced or took away from the subtle flavors of the arancini themselves. We agreed to disagree as we lapped up every last morsel.For our entrées, we chose the Fettuccine with Meatball, Linguini & Clams, and a special of the night, Gnocchi with Lamb Ragu.  The server told us they are know for their meatball which was validated by the many plates passing by us headed to other tables.  Personally I am not a fan of giant meatballs because they can be so dense and dry, relying on the sauce for flavor.  All of our mouths dropped when it arrived, as big as a baseball, sitting atop a bed of fettuccine alfredo with a draping of marinara flowing down its sides. I don't think I've ever seen a meatball that large! All I can say is WOW! That was hands down the BEST meatball I have ever eaten.  It was tender, moist, and extremely flavorful with an almost cloud like texture. I still ponder how they stay together because once we started cutting into it, it nearly fell apart.  Divine!The Linguini with Clams was classically prepared and did not disappoint.  It was not overly sauced and the texture of the pasta allowed the sauce to cling perfectly.  Thumbs up!  The Gnocchi were a different story however.  While the lamb ragu was excellent, the gnocchi themselves were tough and chewy.  I had high hopes for them because they are made daily in house. But these were far from the soft, pillowy gnocchi I was expecting.  I ended up pushing them to the side so I could devour the remaining lamb ragu which was prepared perfectly.  We closed out the night by sharing a Tiramisu.  It was a huge square, traditionally prepared, and lightly dusted with cocoa powder.  We devoured it in less than two minutes.The meal was so good, absent the chewy gnocchi, that we came back the next night with a few other colleagues.  The service was very good, the ambiance perfect for a casual night with friends, and the food speaks for itself (except the gnocchi which is why I dinged them a star).

Birthday couple rented out the lounge so we had the space all to ourselves which was perfect. The place is really great! Ultra small downstairs for 30-40 people. There are two spaces downstairs, the bar and lounge area. We Lao had access to the upstairs dining and sitting room. We ordered food from the bar. They had appetizers and drinks upstairs for us. The vibe was just great! So great in fact that we looked into hosting our engagement party here but they wanted $3000.00!! Eek. I do not remember the birthday party costing that much!! But that was precovid and our engagement was just last year in 2023 so... inflation just ruins things. BUT. If you want to rent the place it's beautiful and hella cute. The food was great.

We went to Bistrolino mid-week thinking that the place would not be quite busy. We were very wrong. The restaurant is small and cozy and can fill up easily. Throughout the evening, they were packed. We observed our hostess-cum-server Jessie run the entire front of house operation by herself with no help, which I think is an opportunity on part of the restaurant's management to do a better job of staffing. As busy as she was, Jessie was efficient, friendly, and patient with all the customers. Besides the wine collection, the restaurant does not have its own bar, so any cocktail order meant Jessie had to go next door to the sister bar (Ferdinand) to bring them back to the tables - again, it's an inefficient and single-threaded process that puts too much stress on the one hostess/server.We ordered the ""Apple Pie Smash"" and ""Black Horse & The Cherry Tree"" for our drinks. Both drinks were very tasty and were much better than the entrees we ordered. The Smoked Salmon Alfredo with Tortellini hardly had any salmon and was mostly tortellini. Similarly, the Rosemary Chicken & Potato Au Gratin dish was mostly potatoes with a few chicken bites on top. We ordered the chocolate mousse dessert, and it was divine. This was definitely our culinary highlight of the evening. Overall, I think this can be a really great restaurant if management provides adequate support to their staff, and more focus can be placed on the main menu items.","Lewis Center, OH",65,137,1629

The best dish was probably the guanciale pizza, which had succulent guanciale, interesting seasoning, and artichoke (which sells itself). I only wish the pieces of guanciale and artichoke were bigger so there was more mouthfeel. The muffaletta sliders were also quite good, with a nice crumbly bread and a thick, melty cheese. The soppressata and mushroom pizza tasted good when you had a bite with mushroom. But I think the other dishes were a bit disappointing. The salmon in the tortellini dish was shredded so finely that there was more of a salmon ~essence~ rather than actual chunks of salmon to dig in to. The batata harra was not bad but not good...it came across as a fairly flavorless potato and onion mash. It just seemed like a dish I personally would maybe not put on a restaurant menu. And I'm just a hater of salads and cannolis so idk.The restaurant certainly has a rustic air, with wine crates and books stacked in the dining area, dim lighting, and an open view of the kitchen. But the limited seating might explain why it took us half an hour past our reservation time to get seated. And this is just a pet peeve, but the server did not write anything down when I was telling them our order, forcing me to repeat things multiple times. I would prefer if waitstaff just took out a pen and paper or something to jot a few notes.Grated parm which came with the pizza was good though. Was eating that sh*t by the spoonful at the end.","Columbus, OH",6,90,1493

The sauce it comes with is sweet and salty, complementing the flavors but impossible to eat it with because it was already so salty. As a Filipino I love rice and salt, but I had to eat a 5:1 rice to meat ratio, which I did not love. We saved over half of it for leftovers because of the unbearable salt. The macaroni salad was also not very impressive; very bland and greasy.

And each was about 2x3, and thick.  Three was a meal, essentially.  Loads of rice, yards of seaweed, and lots of tender flavorful meats in each.  The katsu was big and crispy.  Yum.

Came in with a party of 10, and we did our best to order everything in the menu. I never saw him right anything down, and he didn't miss a single item.... He did come back with some disappointing news twice, first that they were out of the lobster tacos and then again that they were out of the branzino, which was crushing .... But not his fault. He was kind enough to offer a few substitutes that were available in stockI'm the alcohol side of the house I highly recommend the Spanish old fashion.Food wise the wagyu skirt steak was probably my favorite. The scallops were good, but a bit salty for my taste.  I don't recommend the half chicken, it was bland IMHO, the Elote was good but too Smokey for my taste. The pork belly melts in your mouth, but I'm indifferent to the sauce/glaze.

Cheese and meat - great assortment of cheeses. 2. Patatas Bravas - tasty, elevated gourmet fries. 3. Burrata Salad - sweet, refreshing good balance to all the saltiness of other dishes. 4. Octopus - blah. It's a tiny strip. Tasted boiled with this sweet sauce, not complementing each other at all. 5. Grilled Shrimp - juicy and tasty, polenta was good. 6.

Went during 614 Restaurant Week & the 3 course meal was a great deal for $30.We started with the cheesy yucca fries & the sweet plantains w/ shredded cheese.Both were delish but I could have eaten the dip that came with the yucca fries with a spoon. It's basically sour cream at the bottom & torched cubes of panela cheese (the thick non-melty kind that goes inside the arepas in thick slices). The torching of it made it taste like campfire in a good way.We then had the 614 arepas which are basically steak, panela cheese & a creamy cilantro sauce. The steak is unbelievable. So much flavor. We both asked for more sauce on side because it was a bit on the stingy side for the size of arepa & amount of steak in it....and honestly, the sauce is so good I probably would ask for extra regardless.We finished with the Venezuelan flan & tres leches cake. Both were great but I'm more of a flan girl & appreciated the firmer texture & deep flavor without being overly sweet.The cocktail list could use some more inspiration personally. There were a few good options but considering all the fun juices they have, they could have been more variety. I will say from someone who used to work at a Brazilian restaurant, their caipirinhas were very good. Overall, food was excellent, service & atmosphere were great, drinks were ok, but I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu because there's so much authentic well-done food that I need to go back for.","Columbus, OH",74,37,1483

I ended up with a 614 arepa and the Machuca Seafood Soup. First on the 614 arepa. It layered with grilled cheese and overloaded amount of grilled steak. On top of that, drizzled with their cilantro sauce. I can't quite bite into all the ingredients from the first bite, cause it is so big. As I work my way through, I can taste all the flavor become a unison combo. The arepa itself is crunchy, along with the well-seasoned grilled steak and cheesy grilled cheese. If you like seafood, you should totally try this Machuca Seafood Soup. It is slightly creamy from the touch of coconut milk.

We love living here and in fact think we will stay long term; however, I have to admit, I miss good Latin food like we used to have on the west coast. There's been good choices here, but nothing truly close to authentic. This place has been the closest and bursting with Latin flavor. I came as a part of the Yelp elite event, and ordered an arepa. The service is outstanding. They are so friendly and helpful with the menu. I LOVED that they also have a photo menu so you can look at what the food looks like to make your choice easier. I've also had arepas before in California, so I was really excited to get some here.When I say bursting with authentic flavor, I truly mean it. The beef in my arepa was outstanding, so tender and flavorful. Perfectly cooked. The cilantro sauce was the BEST! I wish I got more to go from there...so delicious. My arepa came with French fries or Yuka fries, and I opted with the yuka (solid choice for me). It truly is a Latin fusion restaurant, and I loved how on their menu they rep the country flag where the dish is from. From Mexican, to Venezuelan, to Peruvian with their lomo Saltado. Loved everything about this place. And so cute with the decor! Definitely want to come back with my husband. One more thing I'll add too...I could not believe how well priced this place was.

We began with the Focaccia bread with salted butter and truffle followed by clam soffrito with white wine and parsley. My main entre was the wagyu, pate a choux with pickled peppers. We finished with Yuzu Key Lime Pie. As stated before, it was a memorable meal.","Morris County, NJ",29,672,986

The only option for dinner at the moment is a tasting menu which is inspired by the flavors of Virginia/Appalachia. Dinner last night take 3 1/2 hours (which in itself if enough for me to not come back but there were other issues). The first course is a ham biscuit which would be a great breakfast but is a terrible app. You're basically full after the first course. From there you get three more individual apps and it's the most hodge podge collection of subpar weirdness you can imagine. The gazpacho is visually pretty and a good flavor. The crab roll is legitimately bad. It's crab salad (think crab mixed with mayo) and bacon wrapped inside seaweed like it's sushi. It was not good. Lastly, my entree, which the server categorizad as ""hearty"" (chicken and dumplings) was a bowl of chicken stock with a single soggy dumpling and 5-6 pieces of undercooked root vegetables. Service and atmosphere was great but dining format and food was atrociously awful. We had no alcohol and it was $300 with too for 2 people. Who wants to come back and do that again after they did it once? It's an awful business strategy and an subpar experience. We used to come here for delicious, elevated dining and drinking where you could pass fantastic bowls of beautiful food between friends. That was fun. This is not. Hope you all are listening to feedback and don't ruin a good thing by sticking to this new format and menu.","Columbus, OH",78,101,1570

I went with girlfriends to try their 6 courses tasting menu. Unfortunately the food did not live up the hype. All four of us agreed that they are good, but not worth the hassle for securing a reservation weeks in advance. None were memorable other than the cocktails. I was also not crazy about using small/dessert plate for the entree. Maybe I would come back to try their regular menu when they improve the reservation system.","Columbus, OH",93,48,460

Their menu changes , so she hadn't seen some of the stuff on the new menu.You have to make a reservation weeks in advance. They're pretty busy and open late, but walk-ins are only at the bar. We had a reservation for 8pm on a Tuesday. When I walked in, most tables were filled. No issue though. We got seated right away. They didn't rush us either. And the place slowly emptied out towards the end of the night.The staff is personable. Really nice, smiley people. This isn't really a fancy restaurant even though it gives off that vibe. You can definitely come in here with casual clothes.For the appetizer, we shared the general tso's cauliflower. Very good! They give you a substantial amount. For drinks, I got 1848. It's bourbon mixed with other stuff. Not super strong. My friend got You wanna Pisco me. Refreshing and fruity!For our meals, I got khao soi while my friend got the summer pork sausage pasta. Her meal looked much smaller than mine. But we both couldn't finish.I've had Khao soi before from a Thai restaurant in Long Beach and loved it. Their version tasted spot on with the coconut and curry flavors!For dessert, we shared the maple hazelnut budino. It's not super rich or Puckery sweet which was good. It's a bit pricey, but the food is well made and the chef is really talented. I can't come back often due to the price but I'm definitely excited to return sometime in the near future!Parking around here is parallel.

We had reservations for 4 PM on my birthday (not realizing that there was a half off happy hour from 4 PM - 6 PM)! This was a huge win once we received our bill! Our server (Megan) was absolutely great too  We started off with a bottle of champagne; Galla Flatbread; and Short Rib Bao Buns. The Galla flatbread was delicious! The flavors of the evoo, heirloom tomatoes, pickled onion, roasted garlic, cambozola cheese, arugula, and aged balsamic really compliment each other well! The flavors literally burst in your mouth! The short rib bao buns were super great too! The soft bao buns are topped with tender Bulgogi-flavored meat, pickled shishito peppers, and Asian slaw. You may want to request more than one order of the short rib bao buns as one order only consists of two bao buns. Trust me, you will want more! For our main meals, we ordered Single Smashburgers & Fries as well as a side of Mac & Cheese. The smashburgers were packed full of flavor (the Galla burger sauce was divine); the fries were hot and crispy; and the mac and cheese was nice and creamy! The mac and cheese had a bold, pepperjack cheese flavor which is what I feel sets their Mac and cheese apart from other restaurants' mac and cheese!

Burger week motivated us to come, so glad we did.  We were fortunate enough to find street parking on a very busy Friday night so parking was a breeze.  However there is a lot right across the street that offers parking as well.  You enter and immediately notice the bar is the central focal point. This is clearly an place that goes from dining to social hot spot/bar after the kitchen closes.   It has a large two sided bar, seating maybe 15 on each side.  It offers plenty of screens to watch sports.  Club music, full of bass, plays in the background but not excessively loud--You can still have a conversation without saying ""huh... what did you say""There are two main dining alcoves.  One has hanging ferns  and the other is a series of big rounded taupe booths.  The booth area also has a lot tv screens for watching sports. There is also a line of high top tables that run parallel to the bar and patio seating    So many options!  I prefer the green alcove with the ferns as the lights from the screens is a not excessive over there and the seats are very comfortable. JmoService was great.  i really like how the managers interact with the guests and helps out the staff.  That is always a good sign when they are willing to help the servers out and then mingle with the guests.   I said before, we came in for burger week. I am so glad we did.  Out of our three different places we went to this week Gala Park had the best burger... hands down winner, not only in taste but in value.  It nailed burger week. For $8 we received a big, smash  burger with cambozola cheese, arugula, roasted tomato, galla burger sauce and it was on a great tasting, fresh bun that even had sesame seeds on it.  (So nice to not have a brioche or potato bun)  fries were also included... and there were lots of them!   Omg... it tasted amazing. I think they accidentally sent us the double (burger week was a single) .  I looked on the menu and this burger usually costs $22..... and let me tell you.... I cant believe I am saying this but this burger might be one of the few burgers that warrant that price.  So good. Also, for a ""smash"" burger it wasn't paper thin which was appreciated.   Oh... just so good!!!They are rolling out new menu items next week.   I really like this place. Think we will need to go back and check them out.","New Albany, OH",66,203,2367

It's a fantastic deal and the food was delicious. I was surprised! I had been to Galla in both Columbus and Cincy when they had one, for drinks and night life. It was always just fine. I kept getting ads on insta about their happy hour, so decided to just see what it was about. We arrived early at 5ish, and were pretty much the only people there. We ordered their drinks on special, a rice bowl, salad, tuna poppers, and salmon cakes. All were discounted. They were seriously so delicious! I absolutely love arugula salad and this one was huge! The bartender was so so sweet and we had a great conversation with her. She had bought us shots after our meal. I truly think Galla can become a great dinner spot if they market their happy hour more and show off their food! Similar to what Townhall does, they should invite people in and treat them to a meal in exchange for content and/or Yelp or google reviews. With the location being dark on the outside, it's really hard to know what's inside if you don't know where and what Galla is. It solely looks like a club, which may turn away customers. Especially during the summer, the patio is great for dinner. I definitely recommend checking Galla out!","Northwest Blvd, Grandview Heights, OH",167,209,1249

I talked to the Kenny & Bobby and they set my party up with a private table and champagne to celebrate my friends mom's bachelorette party. This is now my second time at Galla and I highly recommend it to anyone that is in the Columbus area. On Thursday, I got the opportunity to have happy hour pricing and I kid you not the best happy hour deals I have found in awhile. I got two watermelon mojitos for $7 each and they are OBSESSIVE. I also tried the Surf sushi bowl with tempura shrimp, sushi rice, spicy mayo, ginger, ponzu, and unagi glaze. Super good but small portions. Tonight, I tried the Spicy Tuna Poppers with spicy tuna stuffed jalapeños, asian slaw, wasabi-avocado spread, and unagi glaze. All food is AMAZING but a little pricey for me without happy hour.

Sad to see Ichi Japanese BBQ close out, but it transform into YF Chinese Cuisine and a bubble tea shop Teamoji right next door.The set up didn't change up too much inside. They do still have some induction table top for their special pot dishes I think. I usually browse on the menu before I go to a new restaurant. I saw a couples people been talking about the Chicken Wings w. Homemade Sauce cause it topped with... Fruity Pebbles. The chicken wings are very good and flavorful. Super crispy and juicy inside. They chopped the wings in half so it is easier to eat as well. I do like the creativity to garnish the dish with the colorful Fruity Pebbles. For me, I may want to stick back to the traditional garnish, such as diced green and red pepper. But I do encourage to try this as the wings itself is awesome, and the Fruity Pebbles will easily fall off if you don't like it. Or you may end up liking this combo. I also got the House Special Pork Ribs and Chinese Eggplant & Minced Pork W. Chili Sauce. I am a big fan of eggplant and this eggplant dish can be easily fall into my favorite. The eggplant is perfectly soften and soaked in the awesome mild chili sauce.  My last word of cautious is on the big portion size. Totally got enough leftover for lunch and dinner the following week.

My favorite so far has been the Beef Offal appetizer, Griddle Spare Ribs, Pork with Green Peppers, and Lamb with Cumin. It's overall delicious and so flavorful, you can find something for everyone. The only dishes we tried to avoid were the chicken dishes, they come with a lot of bones and not a ton of meat. Most of their dishes come with rice, which is such a great balance and addition to all the sauces and flavors. The prices seem a bit higher, but it's quality food and you get a pretty good portion for everything.Staff is always so nice, very kind, and quick with their service.

Tried YF Chinese Cuisine for takeaway, figured might as well since it's new and 2 mins from our door and I had a $10 ChowBus coupon burning a hole in my wallet (CB added two other smaller magical discounts automatically presumably because we were picking it up ourselves rather than delivery). Overall it was....ok. I think we probably ordered a couple of not their not so greatest hits. Since my SO prefers more traditional (aka americanized) Asian foods, we mostly stayed away from the more authentic offerings and went with two Chinese takeaway standards. Kung Pao Chicken. This was a strange and rather pedestrian take on the dish. If it even held true to its moniker. First oddity to me was the use of chicken (white) breast slices vs (dark) thigh chunks. Typically this dish is made with everything chunked or diced or cubed, theirs was slices or shreds. Always this dish features toasted peanuts, this dish not even one? Very bland as well, but the overall flavor (once I added peanuts and a handful of red chili grinds) was edible. Fwiw the photo on ChowBus is definitely of KPC, but what we got wasn't that photo. YMMV. Orange Beef. Have to admit I haven't had this dish since back when the old Hunan House on 161 was around. I remember they used orange zest and actual fried peels in a delicate sauce and that I enjoyed it. YF must have missed that recipe. Dunno, the sauce was just way too thick and intensely sweet for me. And too salty at the same time if that's possible? Both extremes overshadowed any decent orange essence. The beef shreds were a little on the chewy side which I really don't mind but the SO disliked. Three pieces of broccoli for decoration, I added the sesame seeds for visual appeal. Tbh it was one of those dishes that became tiring to eat after a while. Cold Noodle w/ Shredded Pork. This appetizer (currently on special) was a saving grace. Kind of like pork chow fun makes a baby with DanDan noodles, but it's all served cold. Nice cucumber shreds and hits of fresh cilantro in a light salad-y type dressing/sauce. Be awesome on a really hot day, deserved some added chili spice to make it stellar. Two thumbs up. The cold dish gives hope that maybe their more ""exotic"" offerings are more up to par. Still, there's so many (really good) competitors in this particular food segment and especially in this particular part of town that they're going to need to really step up to get noticed. First try, I wasn't too impressed. I'll update my review with the next round. From what I remember, the restaurant interior didn't change all that much from Ichi Bbq. There's a temporary banner covering the old sign. The single employee at the register was pretty disinterested in my arrival as compared to his cellphone but my order was double bagged nicely and sitting patiently waiting to be grabbed anyway. Easy in/out. Entrees can be a little pricey, especially the hotpot dishes, but that seems to be the trend anymore. Teamoji next door looks intact but closed atm (they will apparently reopen soon). Check them out on the ChowBus app since they don't have a website yet, but all their photos may not be WYSIWYG!  It's always my go-to.","Columbus, OH",36,115,3351

Cumin lamb is way over seasoned with cumin. Wonton soup and general tsos are not good. Hit or miss. This is tough to rate. The portions are what you would expect for their $20 price range. Enough to share with family. The flavor is authentic which I appreciate. However, my cumin lamb was VERY strong. I felt like I was eating straight out of the spice jar... and I love spice so this is saying something. The lamb was cooked well and I like the added watercress inside it. The spare ribs were good, hot and numbing spice. It comes with potato. The wonton soup is the stereotypical soup, but it tasted off. It tasted like the wrappers were frozen burnt and it made the whole thing taste bad. Steer clear of the soup. Not shown in the pictures is the general tsos. Not good. Very soggy and bready.

Great location too (Teamoji is next door and you're allowed to bring their drinks/food to this restaurant--they have great mochi donuts and bubble tea!). Parking is easy. If you don't find parking immediately in front or back, there is a ton of parking in Bethel Center not far from the restaurant. The place was not too busy at 8 pm and service was excellent. Food came quickly and the portions were much larger than expected (feels like much larger portions for the price compared to other Chinese restaurants I've been it in Columbus). Rice came with the meal. For the enormous amount of food that we got (6 dishes), it was more than worth the $106. Definitely will not need to cook for several days with the amount of food we (2 people XD) will be packing up. Every dish we got was very tasty (see photos for names). Would order literally any of them again (except perhaps the Korean chicken--I was expecting fried chicken for some reason, which is my fault. The dish also had a higher proportion of relatively raw onions as filler than I would have liked). Will definitely be coming here for all my Chinese food cravings. I order similar dishes at every Chinese restaurant I go to, and theirs is definitely on the end of better/more authentic Chinese food!","Columbus, OH",598,26,1339

There are two ways to order ahead of time and neither are that great. The first is through Door Dash (if you want delivery), however Door Dash increases the prices of everything by $2-4 which is annoying. The other way is through the Roots mobile app (since everyone needs an extra app on their phone?). After calling the restaurant to see if we could just order over the phone, they politely directed us to the namesake app, so we succumbed to downloading it. Unfortunately, you are only able to place 7 entree orders on the app at once, so we had to make two separate orders for our group.The menu is easy to navigate, with signature bowls, or build your own bowls. Each bowl consists of two bases (grains or lettuces), vegetables, cheese, protein and sauce/dressing. I went with the Balboa, but we had a good variety across the group.The parking is quite limited which is another downside. However since it is located right in the heart of campus, I'm sure they get a lot of food traffic. The food itself was phenomenal and surpassed my expectations.

I wouldn't have ordered the chipotle mayo, oil and vinegar, or salt and pepper on my own, but all of the employee's recommendations were spot on. Normally, I actively avoid chipotle because I just don't like the taste or how it hurts my stomach, depending on where I get it. But I'm so glad I was convinced to try it.

I will definitely be back here and can't wait to try more!Note: There is no seating, so this is take-out only unless you want to sit on the curb... which some people did, so no judgment there.","Columbus, OH",16,166,1561

Frenchi's won't match the size of those Neighbor's sandwiches, but they will match - and even exceed - the flavor. I was ordering for two, getting a pastrami hoagie for my wife and what I thought was going to be a smoked turkey wrap for me. True to other Yelp reviews, the owner steered me in a better direction to the Buckeye which featured turkey, roast beef and pastrami. The meats, custom toppings, homemade chipotle sauce and the garlic & herbs tortilla  blended beautifully. The pastrami hoagie was no slouch, but I'm looking to return to try more specialty sandwiches in wrap form for sure.","Columbus, OH",27,81,657

The roast beef was dry, the yellow mustard threw me, and the gyro was very over sauced-- which is good when it's tzaki sauce but not when it's chipotle ranch!  There are other delis in the area that make sandwiches better than this. Columbus really does need more delis, but I was disappointed. We did not try the crepes, so these might be good.","Columbus, OH",58,249,541

Although, I did not get to watch the musicians perform jazz, because there is a wall that separates the restaurant and the bar, it was still cool that we got to hear it as we ate our dinner. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the lighting was dim, the furniture was, very artsy and cute. Even the bathroom was decorated pretty. We did not wait long at all before our waiter asked us what we wanted to drink, I ordered the ginnocent which tasted amazing. I would recommend this drink if you are looking for a light and refreshing cocktail. The girls ordered different drinks, and they were satisfied with their picks as well. The food was pretty good, the aioli at the bottom of the Brussels sprouts was a nice touch I will say first. The Brussels were super airy and light they deff make a good entree. The rabbit pappardelle was very good also, very spicy. I can't say much about the deviled eggs since I realized after my first bite that, they may have mustard in them, to which I told the restaurant owner who was walking around and checking in on everyone's experience. He took them back for me and gave me French fries which honestly some of the best French fries I've had.

When we walked up, there were a couple people outside, and I walked past them thinking they were guests waiting for someone. Turns out they were the hosts (owners?) actually waiting for us lol. One of them opened the door for us and the other guided us to the podium to check us in. We showed up a couple minutes before our reservation time but were seated immediately. Someone promptly brought us water and Allison introduced herself as our server shortly after. We caught the end of a performance, which was so great I genuinely thought it was a recording until I saw the singer through a window in the dining room.I ordered the Ginnocent based on other reviews. It was a pretty mild, light tasting drink with a pleasantly slight amount of fizz from the sparkling wine. My partner had the Aviator, which was very floral and has a stronger bite. The Gin-Fashioned was very spirit forward yet so smooth. But for me, the highlight of the drinks was the Gin and Tonic. I was a little hesitant to try just because there are so many tempting cocktails and soo many combinations of g&t to choose from, but I think my choice of Roku gin with elderflower tonic was perfect. Not surprisingly, it was the best gin and tonic I've ever had. Honestly, one of the best drinks. Floral and a little sweet, just perfect for my taste. I absolutely recommend trying out some combinations to find one that suits yours!As for the food, it was delicious as well! I personally don't think I'll come back for food unless it's a very special occasion, just because it's very expensive for the size - but for the quality of the food and ambience they've built, I can't fault them for it. The fries were a bit oversalted, but I'd still recommend them. Perfectly crispy and seasoned otherwise. The mussels were perfect! Perfectly soft and spiced, and I unashamedly continued to drink the broth out of the shells and dip my fries in it after the mussels ran out. They also brought me an extra bowl for the shells which was a really nice touch. The rabbit pappardelle was delicious, but as warned, veryyy spicy. I personally couldn't eat more than a couple bites, but it was mostly my partner's and he loved it anyway :) I recommend if you have a high spice tolerance and are craving something truly spicy.It was understandably very loud and packed on Valentine's Day, but I'm really looking forward to coming here on a slower (quieter) night to enjoy some drinks and jazz in the bar!","Columbus, OH",16,166,2536

It is located on north high street, and there is a small lot out back for parking. Hours are limited to dinner time, 5p-11p (12a Fri & Sat), and closed on Tuesday. The website touts live jazz music every day from 5-6:30pm. We made a reservation for 5pm hoping to catch all of the jazz music. Unfortunately, they didn't have the music when we went so not sure if the website is incorrect, or if it was a one off, but either way it was a disappointing start. It is a neat space, with small dining area in the middle, flanked by various rooms that are definitely meant for lounging with a cocktail. Each room has its own style. They have over 30 types of gin, as well as a full bar. They have their own cocktail menu, many of which center around gin. Happy hour is from 5-6pm, with $2 off house cocktails. They also have a kitchen, however I wouldn't call this a true dinner restaurant. Many of the items are more appetizer or small plates to share. They do have a burger and a pasta dish with rabbit confit. I tried to order the latter, but they were out (again disappointing for only being open less than 2 weeks and us having the first reservation of the night). So instead, we tried the shoestring fries, meatballs and croquettes. Overall, Adelaide's is an intimate date night cocktail bar with small plates. They still have some kinks to work out, but I'm sure these will get better with time.","Columbus, OH",460,380,1459

I was incredibly excited to check the place out after seeing a lot of content online from other influencers and because what isn't to love? Moody jazz and classy gin cocktails is a vibe. Everything lined up to be a great experience: live jazz that added a lot of character and ambiance, a modern decor with a sophisticated yet approachable menu, and kind staff. Important to note is the live jazz: you won't get a great view of them unless you sit at their bar BUT they do have speakers throughout the entire space so you won't miss out! When we went they were playing holiday music which was a nice touch. My partner and I shared three dishes: the bread and butter, crispy brussels, and the AG burger. All were perfect portions for two people. Between the bread and the brussels, it is tough to choose which one I like more. The brussels had more depth and layers with the dates, espresso aioli, and mint which made it bursting with flavor. The bread was fresh as they make it in-house, as well as being sweet and slightly spicy from the peppers inside the bread. Both great! The burger was quite large and also very flavorful, with it leaning more sweet from the shallot jam. I love everything on the burger personally so I could've easily eaten the whole thing. Another note that was much appreciated was the waitress having them split it in half before bringing it out. It's the small things sometimes! It all tasted very fresh, unique, and multi-faceted. We also had two cocktails each, where I tried the smoked Gin Fashioned (We are at a gin joint after all!) and their Good Night Irene. Both also strong contenders for complexity. They bring out their smoked cocktails in a small enclosed case where they take off the lid and let all the smoke out - adds a nice aroma and presentation.Overall, I have no complaints other than maybe the dining room seating being compact but really, that isn't a big issue to deter the experience or another visit! We will definitely be back and I highly recommend giving them a try!","New Albany, OH",0,9,2100

For the pick 2, we chose the pulled pork and the ribs. Both meats were very tender, I wasnt necessarily that big of a fan of their bbq sauce choices though. The meat however was great!

Great beer prices in my opinion too which was a great sight to see.  We ordered the fried pickles and cheese curds to start. They were all fried tempura style which was different but very good.

The menu is so interesting with a mix of comfort and creative dishes.  We loved the calamari and shrimp appetizer - full of interesting, fresh flavors.  The burrata appetizer was also delish - my only small critique is the toast was overly crisped/brittle/hard - I would have liked it a bit less so - was difficult to eat.I had the French onion soup again and it did not disappoint - yum!  I ordered the Steak Frites as my main, the steak came perfectly cooked with a small bunch of fresh, simply dressed arugula and a large mound of frites.  The frites were bland, not fresh...nothing special - this dish would have been better served/elevated with fondant potatoes or patata bravas.

Its inside is traditional/formal, and it's the kind of place that you dress up for a bit. On the outside, it's multi-level patio is outright beautiful and a must-visit weather permitting. At the same time, it *is* a restaurant and the food will always be the biggest factor. I went for brunch and tried various items. The beignets were big and fluffy and lightly dusted in powdered sugar. They weren't as dense or sweet as you might expect, and the berry coulis served with them was fine. However the cinnamon butter served with the sugar sprinkled angel biscuits was really good. The croque madame was nice, and the croissant that enveloped it was an interesting treat. The brunch burger was average, and the most memorable part of it was that the toppings just slid off the base and made it difficult to eat. The brunch date ended ended on a high note with white chocolate pot de crème. Definitely would get that again, and truly I would visit Lindsey's for happy hour/dinner if the occasion warranted a fancier location.","Columbus, OH",27,81,1078

Really nice upscale atmosphere, white linens on the tables, very attentive staff. I waited for nothing. The French onion soup was deep and rich in flavor. Good melt on the cheese. The star of the show was the pork chop! Wonderfully cooked, tender and juicy, topped with a delicious sauce.

It's also a plus that complimentary valet is provided. I highly suggest making a reservation. I reserved a spot two weeks in advance, but was only able to get a table for 8pm or later. Service was very attentive and nice. I had answered ""celebrating anniversary"" to the question of special occasion on the reservation. Perhaps because I did that, we got a corner booth table and had an actual candle lit dinner, instead of a battery powered candle like the other tables there. There was, however, no other gesture for the occasion.For starters, we got the confit chicken wings and chilled crab and artichoke dip. The chicken wings were plenty and they tasted great. They had the perfect cook to them and a nice flavor. The crab dip had a lot of crab meat and it was a pretty big amount, so we could not finish. We were also served a complimentary bread basket. The bread was hard and I did not care for it, but the flatbread crisps were very tasty. The portions of all the food was perfect. For our mains, I got the 6 oz filet and my husband got the ruby trout. We both enjoyed our meals a lot. The filet had the perfect cook and was delicious and my husband really enjoyed his fish. The fish with the succostash tasted great and he said he would get it again. For dessert, I got the tarlet that had a mix of guava and passion fruit. If you are a lover of tropical tastes, this dessert is for you. It was decadent and the tart was so silky smooth with a yummy crust. I would get this dessert every time I am there. My husband got the chocolate creme brulee, which was  light and a nice end to his dinner. My only critique is that I noticed that the chocolate custard was a bit runny and could have set more.This is a great place to go for a nice dinner or any celebration. I highly recommend trying them out on restaurant week as you can try a variety of items for much less. We will definitely come here again.","Powell, OH",103,341,1984

They have cookies and scones at the front as well that looked wonderful, but we resisted the temptation to purchase.They have a limited menu, and our selection was delicious.

This is an item Columbus raves about, and now I get why. It's a veggie burger made with beets, black bean, and brown rice, and it's grilled to perfection. My only qualm is that I ordered with no pickles and onion, and it had pickles and onion on it.They expanded the Short North location in the past year or so, and there are plenty of booths available with a view of High Street, but you can also order takeout, park in their lot onsite, and they'll bring the food out to you.  They do have free parking next to the building, but spots are limited.

I ordered the fish and chips - this was a large portion and the breading was nice and crispy without being overly greasy. My friend ordered the smash burger which was well undercooked. She could not eat it. They offered to bring her something else but she had lost her appetite so they gave her a $25 gift card and offered to buy her a dessert. I thought that was very fair of them.

We were all pretty full. And there were 5 of us!We got Brussels sprouts, duck fat popcorn, poutine, and wings (maple bourbon and garlic). The Brussels sprouts were amazing! Perfect crispness and well seasoned. The duck fat was also good. Poutine was alright. Good but nothing special. The wings were my least favorite. Tender and fall off the bone but the flavors were weird. Just not my favorite at all. I would skip it.Overall, not a bad time! The large portions for apps is a selling point. Drinks were good too! I got a Moscow mule that I slowly sipped on.Service was good! Our server did a great job coming around to check on us and made good suggestions from the menu.It's a nice vibe though!

The ambiance was nice, very modern inside with lots of windows, but save your time and money and go somewhere else as the ambiance was the only decent thing! The service was alright, for it not being super busy for Saturday brunch it took our waitress a while to circle back, ring us out, etc. Our water pitcher did not contain water - it tasted like some carbonated, ginger beer or something. Waitress didn't let us know about an up charge for GF bread and I didn't see it listed in the menu. The blueberry pancakes were actually sent back to the kitchen for their taste and texture. ‼ I recommend First Watch for the same type of advertised ""healthy"" food, NO up charge on gluten free bread, and a much bigger and tastier menu.

Even the 2 pc chicken tenders come with the usual white bread and pickles which were fairly standard. You can request for ranch dipping sauce for the tenders which I did, at no additional charge. The chicken tenders were good but the batter is not that thick and flavorful, so the ranch sauce helped carry the chicken tender flavors a lot. The coleslaw is fairly creamy but tasted just like regular coleslaw, which is okay. Make sure to check in on Yelp for $5 off!

Searching through Yelp and Doordash, I found a tasty-sounding menu at Hot Chicken Takeover.I can't comment on the service beyond ""They followed instructions."" Ditto, no comment on the ambiance.The food, though, that I can comment on.I ordered chicken tenders, medium spice. It was cooked perfectly, juicy, with just the right amount of spice. YMMV. It came with waffle fries that were hot and crunchy.What I did wrong was to get sucked into ordering fried pickle chips, because I love some good ones. As you might imagine by my tone here, they were not good. They could have been; they were fried nicely. The problem was they were entirely too salty. Inedibly salty for my taste.So order chicken and pass on the pickles.","Tallahassee, FL",25,316,840

It's hard to believe that a meal that cost $11.25 in December 2019 could now be a whopping $18.25 but that's the shameful reality here.Surely this must be because of those ""difficult times"" that their Yelp PR lady blamed earlier...

A real shame, I've been frequenting since the pop-up carryout window in Old Towne East back in 2014. I'm going to miss them.Since opening their brick & mortar in 2015 all the way through May 2019: Dark (Thigh & Leg) + Slaw + Mac + Tea + as much ranch as you want = $10.50December 2019: Dark + Slaw + Mac + Tea + as much ranch as you want = $11.25May 2020: 2 thighs (no more ""Dark"" meal, now you have to choose between 2 thighs or 4 drumsticks) $8 + Slaw $1.75 + Mac $2.25 + Tea + as much ranch as you want = $12Today: 2 thighs $8.95 + Slaw $2 + Mac $2.50 + Tea $1 + Ranch 1 free then $.50/ea (let's say you go with 2 extras) = $15.45A 50% price increase!OK, times are tough and costs are higher, right... I'm sure it has nothing to do with opening a new Columbus location in a pricey area (Dec. 2020) and two locations in Cleveland (Oct. 2019, May 2021) during this same timeline.I can think of plenty of places to eat for $15 a plate that don't have me sitting at a picnic table eating out of a takeout box and bussing the table when I'm done. In their own words HCT is a ""fast-casual"" chain. Bibibop, Fusian, and Piada (all based out of Columbus, all at a $10 price point) have each managed to expand widely and make it through the pandemic without having to dramatically increase prices. Plus, taking two things that you used to advertise as ""always free!"" and charging for them just feels especially cheap. Do they really need 50c for a couple tablespoons of ranch or $1 for a cup of sugar water in order to keep the lights on? I doubt it.Edit: I wonder if they could have kept prices the same if they hadn't hired someone who responds immediately to every Yelp review that mentions the pricing with ""we had to make hard choices."" If it's just this ""hard environment"" that caused the increase, does that mean we can expect these changes to be temporary? I wouldn't hold my breath.","New York, NY",11,231,1970

What am I doing? What am I thinking?What I'm doing - eating the various birria style tacos at a concerning paceWhat I'm thinking - DAMN, THESE ARE GOOD!Look, Agave & Rye isn't authentic. I've seen it played out in numerous Reddit forums that they're not the real deal. But guess what? I'm in the Midwest. Why would I look for Al pastor street tacos carved off a trompos? Yes, it'd be absolutely fabulous if I found it, but I live in Ohio. I'm just aiming for delicious. I've had a few of their apps, but I always come back to the dip sampler. I will never turn down guac or salsa, and the queso is pure crack. I'm not even a queso person (gasp!) and yet I'm *that* bish at the table that hordes 3/4 of the shared serving to herself.Agave & Rye has an extensive taco menu, but I stick to birria. One, because birria is my go to no matter what menu, but two, I think it's because it's the best deal. While their singular taco concoctions are delicious and unique, paying nearly $10 for a singular taco is highway robbery. It's the same issue I have with Condado. The birria tacos, however, come in packs of three for about $14. I've tried their newer flavors, but I always come back to the original. A pound (my estimate) of cheese, slow cooked beef, and a flavorful consume is one few things that I will never say no to.I'm proud of my friends at Agave & Rye. They're expanding to other cities, and they've even opened a steakhouse in Liberty Township! If you do not currently reside near an Agave & Rye, I hope one moves next to you soon so you can also experience the food that melts this icy, picky for Tex-Mex girlie's heart.","Cincinnati, OH",226,470,1766

The available parking seemed to be street parking and it was a bit difficult to find space. There are surrounding garages that you can park in and walk. The restaurant was cool, decorated in lots of colors, lights, and very fun.We got Birria Tacos, the Grilled Birria Burrito, and Birria Irish Nachos.The tacos and burrito were delicious! They were a bit greasy, but expected. Balanced flavor, hardiness, meaty, and filling, and I loved the broth, I thought it was flavorful and seasoned well. The burrito alone is a bit heavy, but adding the salsa and sour cream was a good touch. The entrees are made well!The Birria Irish Nachos are actually fries, not chips. I really liked this appetizer that could be a meal alone. It was a good balance of salty, sweet, crispy, and soft.Our server actually recommended the Birria dishes and we ordered them all. Our server was fantastic, fun, and attentive. We were taken care of and our server made sure to explain the menu and was so nice!Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and restaurant.

My partner and I were in town for a conference, and this restaurant was conveniently located just a stone's throw away from the Hilton hotel where we were staying. We sat at the bar to avoid the lunchtime rush/wait. My partner liked the OG margarita. The elote was heavy on the lime, but refreshingly had just the right amount of mayo, not flooded the way restaurants often do where it feels like you're eating more mayo than corn. The queso birria was delicious and generously portioned with chips that seemed to have been made in house. The corn fritters were also tasty. Note: the price for the tacos is for one larger than average taco with a crunchy corn taco shell wrapped with a soft flour tortilla (they don't seem to have soft corn tortilla shells). I ordered the crown jewel which has lobster and Mac n cheese within the taco. The first bite was delicious, the lobster fresh and slightly sweet, but the taco overall was a bit too decadent for my taste. I ended up just picking out and eating the lobster and the Mac n cheese without the taco shells. The ambience in here is very hip and artful (think glass chandeliers in cages and colorful murals on the wall), and overall, this was a pleasant find and I would come back if I'm ever in the area again!","Union City, TN",0,3,1389

They've got two locations in town, but we went to this one because some of our friends had some things to do downtown. Parking isn't bad. There's a parking garage by North Market, but some of my friends found parallel spots nearby.This used to be Fuzzy's tacos. It wasn't great, so I'm glad this replaced them. The space is large, tons of tables. We sat near the front which had a view of the TV and the bar area.Most of us got the OG Marg, while some of my friends sipped on bourbon or beer. The OG margs are always a solid choice!!I've had quite a lot from the menu since I've been a lot to the one in Louisville. I decided to go with Bee Keeper, which was one of the tacos that was discounted for Taco Tuesday. Delicious! And a seemingly healthier option. It had grilled chicken, slaw, and a jalapeño salsa.One taco fills you up. Or you can order two. Three is quite a lot! Probably because the taco fillings are actually a generous portion. They didn't skimp on the chicken in my taco.We also shared chips with queso. Yum!Our server came around once every so often. They weren't overly busy, but I couldn't tell if they were understaffed.

When my dish arrived they apologized for the delay but I think they forgot about me. It really took so long that I kept looking back thinking the next dish up would be mine but wasn't.I had the Chicken Patty Katsu ($14) - House-Made Chicken Sausage Patty, American Cheese, Tonkatsu Sauce, Kewpie, and Soy Cucumber on Japanese Milk Bread. It was gross. The patty was good and so was the soy cucumber but the two slices of cold processed American cheese singles with overwhelming amounts of what tasted like bbq and mayonnaise make me nauseous. I would recommend no cheese and requesting some light sauce.  I added the Seasoned Fries ($3) and those were great but that Lemon Shiso Aioli was a miss.My partner had the Mama Chien's Dumplings ($12) - Pork Filling, Mama Chien's Dumpling Sauce, Cilantro. It was more appetizer size and not a dinner portion. It was good just order some other to go with it or it's perfect for a shareable appetizer.I think if you were drinking and wanted some food it would be a better fit, but definitely not an enjoyable real dinner experience.

I don't really drink, but was quite thrilled with the mango cocktail Anna gave me a taste of. Delicious. The crab rangoon small plate was very good. Loved the smooth creamy whipped cream cheese. It had true crab on top, which is great; you obviously pay for it, but if I'm gonna chuck it over, the price better equal to quality. Job well done on this one. The thigh/onion skewer was a solid nod, too. Didn't blow my mind, but the dark meat was juicy and the seasoning wasn't a turnoff.

There was a runner delivering food upon completion.The music was a little loud for conversation, but wasn't horrible.My XXX Sour cocktail was really good.My Chicken Patty Katsu was pretty tasty.  I was excited about it being served on Japanese Milk Bread becasuse I have recently seen it being made on a you tube video.  It wasn't as soft & fluffy as I imagined, but still had a nice texture.My side of Seasoned Fries with Lemon Shiso Aioli was, well, they weren't fresh-cut, but still ok.  The Aioli was fantastic!It seems to be very well-run and organized.  I think this is a cool addition to the area and wish them well.

Easily two meals. You can choose how you'd like the patties to be cooked and we chose medium; they were so juicy *salivates*. I'm honestly not generally a saucy or hammy (as in the pork) person but I would recommend the Hawaiian burger bc it's so flavorful. Yum yum teriyaki sauce.Zucchini fries were *chef's kiss* so crunchy and also a vegetable (everyone claps).We came here on the recommendation of a friend we'd made in maintenance work who said Thurman's Cafe was his birthday spot.

We went here around 30 min after opening and still had to wait 45 min on a Thursday (we were quoted 25-30 min which is very inaccurate). There's ample seating but the main culprit is that service is way too slow. On to the food. Food is nothing spectacular - it just tasted like American diner burgers. The Thurmanator was a giant beast and can easily feed 3-4 people for a satisfying meal and it is a massive upgrade to the Thurman burger that is the most popular. We also subbed chips with the Coney and Cheese fries for $6 more which felt more greasy than flavorful - animal fries from In N Out are far better. The western burger is fairly standard with the BBQ sauce and such, but it is a solid choice nonetheless. The onion rings are fairly good.  Service is sloooooow. Our dining experience is unnecessarily long with 15-20 min of waiting to get water and food and other requests, amounting to a 2 hr experience.

Three giant pieces are just hard to eat and not as enjoyable when you have to cut into them. The spicy miso was just alright. I wanted more flavor in the broth. I added chicken thigh to mine but was unaware that it already comes with that? I also added corn which was an increase in price that seemed silly. The two pieces of chicken that I ate were so chewy in texture that I did not eat the remainder of my chicken. The packaging of the food was great and my order was ready promptly.

"The Refectory Restaurant","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-refectory-restaurant-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Luke K.",5,"2024-02-02","We made a reservation at Refectory for 5:15pm on a Saturday. They sent two text messages to confirm the two days leading up to the reservation, despite me confirming the first one. That said, they had a personalized celebration card on our table when we were seated which was a nice touch. We were a bit surprised that the restaurant was already half full by the time of our reservation, especially since they only open at 4:45pm. The inside is pretty cool with a few different seating areas. It used to be a church that has since been renovated and the Refectory took over in 1976. For drinks, I got the 'Bold Fashioned' and my SO got the 'Summer Spritz'. My bold fashioned definitely lived up to it's name and packed a ton of heat, thanks to the fresno peppers, habanero agave and habanero bitters. I enjoy spicy foods, but did not find myself a huge fan of this much heat on top of the warmth from the bourbon. So order with caution, especially if you have acid reflux. We also split an espresso half way through the meal and it was one of the better espressos I've had, served with a lemon peel, which surprisingly went really well with the rich flavor of the espresso. For dinner, we indulged in the chef's tasting menu. It was spread out over five courses and included French Country Terrine, Pan-Seared Kanpachi, Roasted Filet, Double Cream Camembert, and Strawberry and Chocolate Entremet. They also included two surprises, a seafood medallion as the first starter, and a lemon gelato half way through to cleanse the palate.The plates we liked, we really liked (fish and filet). But we didn't enjoy some of the others (seafood medallion, french country terrine, double cream camembert), because of either the texture or taste, which I'm guessing is just a difference of palate preference. For example, neither of us had heard of or eaten Terrine before, but quickly learned it's a mix of various meats and vegetables all mashed together into a loaf and served in slices. I'm sure this is very popular in Europe, but the look of this mystery meat patty jaded both of us before we even tried a bit. That said, the champagne vinaigrette it was paired with was delicious. Our server Michelle was very nice and knowledgable about the history of the restaurant and the menu. However, the service was quite slow even for a chef's tasting menu. We expected it to take around 2 hours, but it ended up being 3 hours for just the two of us, and that's with us eventually just asking for the check to be brought out with the last course.Overall, I'm torn with what to give Refectory, but believe 3 stars fits the bill for our experience. The chef's tasting menu provided a good variety of different plates, and we enjoyed the main courses, but the others just didn't do it for us. If we came back, we would order from the regular menu, selecting single entrees we would surely enjoy. The presentation of the food was top notch, but the 3 hour meal for two people is just not something I have the patience for either.Of note, they add a 3% fee to credit cards.","Hillsboro, OH",54,37,3055

There's plenty of space outside and decent amount of seating inside. It's pretty loud and lively inside.I got the mussels, crawfish, an egg, and with Kai's spice. The spice/sauce was delicious and so flavorful but because they add the sauce post steam, the crawfish meat was a bit bland. The crawfish was decently cooked, they were a bit small but tasty. The mussels were fantastic and cooked well. The entire meal was good, but I feel like it was so expensive for what it is. I will probably only come back if I was really craving this.The lobster rolls were pretty good as well, could use a bit more flavor but made well. They're a bit expensive, but they do have a happy hour deal for two. The Cajun fries were also really yummy, covered in Kai's sauce and garlic. I think the fries were good but can be heavy with the boil. The calamari was crispy, plain on its own, but came with two sauces.Staff was nice and helpful! Our server explained things well, but seemed a bit flustered and forgot a couple things sometimes.

I heard great things about Kai's from multiple people.  Last night, I thought to myself, crab legs sound great for dinner.  Kai's where we sent the truck heading.We were greeted by two smiling faces at the door.  They seemed genuinely happy to see us.  We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant.  Quickly one of those two smiling faces brought over a paper menu, kind of the catch of the day with the market prices on it.  Our servers name was Jordan and he was an absolute delight the entire night.He found out that we had never been to Kai's before.  He took the time to give us an entire run down of the menu, ordering process, and some of his personal suggestions.  He was so thorough and knowledgable when it came to all the options.  In the end we went with the pro.  Whatever Jordan suggested, we said yes to.He delivered our cold beers, we sat back and relaxed, but honestly it was not for too long because our ""boil bag"" came out.  It is truly your seafood double bagged in huge plastic bags, piping hot, with the melted butter and seasonings sloshing around in the bag marinating all your shellfish.  As suggested by Jordan we went with the Pacific Combo with the crab leg clusters and the head off peel and eat shrimp.  We choose the Kai's seasoning and we went with mild in the bag, but medium on the side.  When you open the bag the ingredients are steaming hot.  We suited up in our gloves and bib and we dug in.I was in love after the first bite.  Both the shrimp and the crab legs were cooked perfectly, not under done and definitely not rubbery or hard, meaning not over done.  The seasoning was good.  I dipped all my shellfish in  the Kai's medium that I got on the side.  When we come back next time, we will definitely go with medium.We were so thrilled with our choice (all credit should go to Jordan).  We were beyond please with our service from Jordan!  It was a true delight all night.  We know we will be back and we hope Jordan will be there to take care of us.  The night was perfect.  If you are like me and you have not made it out to Kai's yet, change that!  You will be thrilled!  Ask for Jordan!!!","Easton, Columbus, OH",6,86,2220

Although it's a bit dated inside and didn't seem sparking clean. The portions are very generous! We love having a little ""buffet"" of items and it makes for great leftovers. It's also packaged really well and we haven't had anything spill, the care to package is very appreciated.The food though.... It delivers every single time! The most outstanding items have to be Shanghai Noodles & Cilantro Pork. We get these every single time because we can't imagine takeout without these two.We have also gotten the Twice Fried Fish that was very good, my partner isn't a big fish fan but LOVED this dish. The fern root salad is so interesting and very unique. We don't get this often but it's a must try for your second or third time here. Fried rice was ok, not as flavorful as I would want. The Sichuan Beef dish is pretty good as well, I have had it before at other restaurants and this one seems lacking something? We recently got the General Tso Chicken as my partner loves this particular dish and it was super disappointing. The sauce was just ok, but the chicken breading was soggy (like the chicken was defrosted and then steamed, gross!).

Well friends, the day finally came over the weekend when my boyfriend and I decided we didn't feel like cooking. I mentioned that we rarely order Chinese food so we decided to try a new spot. And that's when it happened. We ordered off their website for pick up and headed there about twenty minutes later. Everything smelled so good in the car and we dove in the second we got home. We shared an order of the vegetable gyoza and I ordered the spring rolls and vegetable fried rice. My boyfriend ordered an egg roll and general tso's. We legit ate in silence, which is a sign that we are very happy with our food. And eventually, we both proclaimed that this was some of the best Chinese food we've had in Columbus. What stuck out the most to me was how everything was super flavorful. I was so glad I ordered a large fried rice because the leftovers the next day were just as good.

Fluffy, crusty, and perfectly balance with the creamy butter it came with. Apps were great! As for mains, two of us had Pasta Rossi along with one lasagna. Every one of us enjoyed our dinner.

High ceilings, gorgeous wood, padded bar seats and bar face so your legs aren't brushing against a hard surface. We sat at the bar where the bartenders and servers were noticeably friendly and attentive. Ultimately, this is one of my favorite happy hour menus in Cbus (half off pizzas, shareable, and $6 cocktails). We decided on a mushroom pizza, which had a nice umami flavor, crispy thin crust, and was pretty large and more than enough for two people to share. The calimari was crispy, nicely seasoned, and came with a unique basil dipping sauce (plus more traditional marinara). Finally, the margarita was a bit weak but still pretty good for $6.

However, the OH pizza was delicious, crispy, sweet, spicy, fantastic. I would recommend this pizza, it's very good. We also got the meatballs, bruschetta, and truffle popcorn. I was not expecting the meatballs to be two massive balls, it was good and delicious, just a bit too salty. The popcorn was a bit soggy, but truffle flavor was good. The bruschetta also came on just two slices of bread and covered in tomato and balsamic vinaigrette goodness.The appetizers we got during happy hour ranges from $3-$4. We also got the mini Cosmo and Lemon Drop, and chardonnay to sip and those were good to pair with everything. I preferred the Lemon Drop a bit more, it gave a good sour and sweet balance.Overall, with mini drinks, appetizers, and pizza, the cost was about $53 before tip. It's not too bad when we shared with 3 people. I would come back for their pizza and a couple apps! I really like the atmosphere of the bar and staff was very nice and patient with us. Staff was nice to accommodate us and allowed us to choose somewhere else to sit.I would recommend this place for a casual date, a drink, and a delicious pizza.

The drinks were a great price with the happy hour deal and were delicious, my favorite I tried was the French 75.For the entrees, we ordered two pizzas, the truffle and the meatball pizza. The truffle was good but lacked flavor, I would have liked more balsamic glaze or maybe a thicker crust.

The marinara sauce in which they're smothered are terrific. On the snack menu, the bread service is soft, tasty and served with sea salt tinged butter that makes the dish noteworthy. I tried the giardiniera which featured larger than expected pickled vegetables which were a fine balance to the bread and meatballs. Drink-wise, the happy hour menu mostly features discounted wine pours, but I opted to go with a $4 draft which left me with no regrets. Though I was getting full, I split the Pasta Rossi with my wife. The kitchen was nice enough to divide their signature entree into two small plates for us which was emblematic of the great service there. We wanted the tiramisu for dessert, but it wasn't available on the day we visited. We settled for a tasty limoncello cake which they comped for us.

Distant positioned from the Short North, campus, Clintonville, and Worthington, El Arepazo's location on the south side is visible gold bullion on a High Street island that has mostly been abandoned in recent years. Copious/Notes used to be a draw across from El Arepazo, bringing in thousands of guests in 2015-2018. Now, there's a Local Cantina, Antiques on High, Chipotle, First Watch, and a niche rock venue around the corner... the area is comprised mostly of attorney offices and heavily reserved parking spots, but if you seek it out like a travel destination, El Arepazo truly becomes a place to arrive and enjoy.When seated and speaking Spanish cordially with the well-traveled server, I was transported back to memories of the northern coast of South America, backpacking in hostels, and turfing through the Minca jungle on mud-ready motorcycles. It takes a lot to send me 2,000 miles south, but El Arapezo did just that.","Columbus, OH",1718,180,1236

Four of us dinned tonight and the experience was nice but could use improvement. Dishes came out of in batches as if their timing was off. Two of us had our dinner plates and the other two had to wait a bit so we sat there until all plates arrived and they hadn't cleared the finished app dishes on the cramps table. This happed with dessert and drinks too. Back to the dishes, they sat on the table forever and we had to hand off menus and empty dishes and ask if they could take them away.For the price point I would expect better service but again the food was good and looked pretty but just was average. Highlighting everyone was friendly and pitching in for each other so it wasn't that bad, just ok.To mention again, they have a 3.50% credit card fee added to the bill. I hate when business do this in general and do not make you aware verbally. Just bad taste. This is a higher price point restaurant and not a small business vendor. Very offsetting to me.

This dish is a masterpiece, boasting a bold and dark roux that sets the stage for a symphony of flavors. The amalgamation of smoked sausage, tender chicken, and Beeler Farms Ham creates a hearty and satisfying gumbo that keeps me coming back for more.One of my favorite rituals is to perch at the bar and indulge in the delightful combination of the Gumbo and a Cranberry Mule when in season. The freshness of the scallions sprinkled on top adds a burst of color and a refreshing touch to the rich, savory gumbo.For those looking to explore a variety of Gallo's offerings, The Gallo's Half & Half is an excellent choice. The combination of a perfectly crafted Meatball and Sausage with Peppers & Onions, all bathed in Pomodoro Sauce, is a taste sensation. The Oven Roasted Polenta Cake, adorned with daily seasonal ingredients and served with Gallo's Marinara, is a delightful accompaniment. Don't miss the Arancini - Arborio Rice Balls deep-fried to perfection and served with Marinara Sauce. The Sea Salt Brined Fresh Chicken Wings are a must-try, rounding out the perfect array of appetizers for a culinary journey.When it comes to the main course, the choice between Pasta Russo and Chicken Etouffee is a delightful dilemma. The Cavatelli with bolognese sauce in Pasta Russo is a comforting dish, with the Italian meat sauce made from a blend of pork, beef, and veal. On the other hand, the Chicken Etouffee is a classic, featuring succulent chicken in a ham shank fortified deep roux-based gravy, served elegantly with rice.Whether you're seeking a romantic evening or a lively social happy hour, Gallo's Kitchen is the ideal destination. The warm ambiance, impeccable service, and, of course, the delectable menu make it a culinary haven in Columbus.

(gluten-free and vegetarian being the exception.)  Looking for a little bit of N'awlins taste and great  flavor in Cbus, then Gallo's Kitchen is f'sho the dining spot  for you. Billing itself as an Italian/ Creole/Cajun restaurant,  in my opinion, it is the Creole/Cajun dishes which shine and excel, keeping me coming back for more.   I'll leave the Italian dishes and sandwich selections for others to review. ;-)The 3 main indulging reasons to come are: Jambalaya, Seafood Creole stew and the Steak.  All are top notch options arousing the sight, taste and aromatic senses. The Jambalaya does not hold back in flavor and punch.  A hearty mix of meat and rice in a spicy broth of tomato, onions and peppers.  The steak......its worthy of a creole dance.  Honestly, it is as good as any prepared at an ""upscale"" steakhouse.  I think it is because of the cooking technique coupled with the  special seasoning that makes it a standout. Everyone I know who has eaten this entree,  raves about it  and how perfectly cooked to order it is.  But my FAVORITE, has to be the SEAFOOD CREOLE STEW.  Love this dish!!!  Every time I order it, I take a picture like I have never ordered it before.  I think the seafood consists of what is fresh and available at the time.  I've had it with mussels, scallops and different types of fish.   My only peeve,  there is never enough rice.  But, the sauce can stand on its own and I would recommend soaking the bread servings in it. (This is considered good taste in some parts).  I have always had to ask for a container after ordering this dish, as it is enough for two meals.  Worth every penny. The menu here does not change seasonally. They stick to doing what they do, and what they do, they do very well. However, every now and then you will see something different, added/deleted.  But the core entrees remain the same.  This works on many levels.As for the open spaced dining area, it can feel cramped and oftentimes is ""gumbo ya ya"", everyone talking at once.  This design does not lend itself  to intimacy or privacy of any kind. On the many occasions I have been here, regardless of day, it has been crowded, seemingly with neighborhood folks and their families, with a sprinkling of cross towners (that would be me). Be sure to make reservations to ensure minimum wait time.  The bar area is better choice for couples and single people, though it fills up fast, seating on first come, first served basis.  There seems to be a lot of TVs for the size of the Kitchen, which only adds to the high level of noise.  Finally, check their website for special events including Mardi Gras specials. Ciao!

Friends wanted to go, so we joined. I got the seafood stew or something along those lines, and it came with a tiny scoop of rice. For $34 I would expect at least a respectable amount of rice, but it was probably the smallest helping I've ever gotten from a restaurant. There were scallops, mussels, and shrimp maybe one thing I'm missing but there was very little flavor. One of the mussels didn't open up and I got it out right away and tried to eat it, but a few bites in the bad flavor of the mussel ruined the dish. They took it off my bill and offered me something else, but I declined. She told me that had a bad batch of mussels and they thought they got them all, but I guess I would think they'd check that before the served it. Maybe it would have been better if that didn't happen and I would have liked the flavor, but I'm not sure. The scallops were cooked well though. Not sure why, but my wife decided to get a burger and it was pretty dry and lacked flavor as well. Her fries were really good.

Beautiful lighting, seating, it makes you feel like royalty without the larger price tag. 2/5 for the service. There were only a few tables on a week day night, but our server was very slow. The kitchen was very slow. The bartender was very slow. Even if they had 1 of each, there were maybe a dozen people in the restaurant in total.4/5 for the food!

I would make reservations before heading over. You can call ahead and ask which parking garages they validate. The Joseph garage is where we parked, which is a block away and the host was able to validate our parking ticket on the way out. We learned they were having restaurant week when we went, so decided to go with the three course menu for $45/person. The filet on their regular menu was priced at $53.99, which alone is more than the price of the three course dinner this week.I ordered the shrimp bisque, 8 oz filet, and olive oil cake. The shrimp bisque was full of flavor, had shrimp bits, and even two whole shrimp in it. I really enjoyed the bisque. I ordered the filet medium rare, but it was on the rarer side for me. The couple next to us sent back their medium rares saying it was still rare. Other than the cook on the steak, it was thick and flavorful. The side salad that came with it had blue cheese, but the server replaced it with parmesan for us as per pur request. The olive oil cake was great. It was moist and dense and the orange whipped cream really complimented the cake. I also ordered a virgin pineapple dance drink. It was way too sweet to be able to enjoy though.My husband got the guac and chips as his appetizer and the warm chocolate brownie with brown sugar ice cream. The guac was fresh and the brownie was good, but the olive oil cake is the way to go. I appreciated that the restaurant week menu had full serving sizes of all the original menu items. A lot of times dessert and the size of filet are lessened during restaurant week at other places. I would like to go back and try their salmon entree.FYI: If you are celebrating a special occasion and note it on your reservation, do not expect anything extra like what some other restaurants may do. Here, the hostess will wish you for the occasion and that is it.","Powell, OH",103,341,1909

I actually can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. From the service to the food to the ambiance, it was just amazing. We had a 6:30pm reservation, but we went a little early and couldn't find street parking. I called the restaurant to see if they validate parking in the garage and the person that was on the phone took their time on explaining to me that they do validate and where it would be best for us to park. Tip: If you want your parking to be validated, call the restaurant to find out which garage they validate parking for. They do not validate for some of the garages, even though some of the garages are close to them. Ok! So for the food, for appetizer, we ordered a salad-Emerald greens, and Shrimp bisque. My husband doesn't, like brussels sprouts nor quinoa and he probably had more of the salad then I did. It was so good. And shrimp bisque was equally delicious. My 7 year old just devoured it. I had the salmon, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. If you don't like salmon, order it from here.  You will end up liking the salmon. It's so good. We also ordered the cheeseburger from the kids menu. The cheeseburger was so big.  It can easily be for an adult. For the dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake and Olive Oil Cake. Both of them were great and I love chocolate cake, but for this place, I highly recommend for you to order the Olive Oil Cake. It's like a delicious pound cake that just melts in your mouth. Highly recommend this place. It's a great place to go for special events, date nights or just for simply great food with great service.","Columbus, OH",6,76,1662

For my first course I ordered the shrimp bisque, which very good. Really creamy and not overly salty as some bisque tend to be. The main course - I ordered the 6oz filet which came with a simple salad. The filet was seasoned so well and tender.

Then our mains: 2 filets and the scallops. All were perfectly cooked as specified, and outstanding.  Olive oil cake and brownie desserts followed, outfitted with a birthday candle presentation, and we ended a great meal.The decor is sparkling- we sat in the back, which was slightly more subdued but more intimate for conversation.

While the dinner did feel romantic because of the atmosphere, we were very disappointed with the experience. For being called fine dining and definitely a higher price point, it didn't feel that way. Our main dishes arrived very shortly after receiving our appetizer (despite ordering them separately) and therefore our small plates were cleared away and we didn't really get to enjoy the appetizer. I also had a glass of wine I was savoring (it was $20 after all) and it was taken from me before I finished, without asking if I was finished or asked if I wanted another. Just things like that that really miss the mark and made the evening feel not special. Speaking of special. We mentioned our anniversary in the reservation, and when we arrived we were told happy anniversary. We had a table in the corner, near another couple celebrating their anniversary. I know because the waitress wished them over and over a happy anniversary, and gave them a free dessert. We heard no such thing, just told happy new year (it was February 2), it was almost comic like, us hearing ""happy...new year!"" We did order an ice cream dessert (no other dessert options, which is surprising) and THAT took a long time to come out (unlike our main dish and appetizer spacing), and it looked like a candle had been removed from the ice cream. But that was it, no warm service, no congrats, nothing. A very disappointing dinner, and we have commented at other restaurants since that evening that it would be been better to celebrate at those restaurants. Will not be back. Oh wait- Just realized I never talked about the food! It was good! My veggie salad was BIG and very tasty. The whipped mashed potatoes were heavenly. The broccolini was too heavely dressed, but he really liked the salmon. The burrata appetizer was good, but didn't get to enjoy most of it.","Columbus, OH",53,225,1941

It may help to Uber here, because we got blocked in.  They share their parking lot with a car service business, & the parking lot is overflowing from them.","Denver, CO",0,4,526
"Koshi - Korean food and sushi","https://www.yelp.com/biz/koshi-korean-food-and-sushi-columbus-2?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Rebecca P.",5,"2023-12-20","**Restaurant Review: Authentic Korean JjamPpong in Columbus, Ohio**Nestled within Columbus's international market food court, KOSHI surprises diners with an authentic taste of Korean cuisine, specializing in the delectable JjamPpong and fried chicken dish. While the ambience might reflect the casual setting of a food court, the exceptional quality of their dishes and impeccable service transcend the typical dining experience.**Food Quality (5/5):** The star of the show, the JjamPpong here, is an absolute delight. Brimming with a rich and well-balanced seafood broth, packed with fresh ingredients like succulent shrimp, mussels, so many veggies, and perfectly cooked noodles, each spoonful tantalizes the taste buds with a harmonious blend of flavors. The spice level is pretty spicy but manageable but it's originally a spicy dish. **Service (5/5):** Despite the bustling food court atmosphere, the service at KOSHI remains remarkable. The staff's attentiveness, friendliness, and knowledge about the menu contribute significantly to the overall dining satisfaction. They are quick to assist, making recommendations and ensuring a seamless experience for every guest.**Ambience (4/5):** Being situated within a food court, the ambience is understandably more casual and may lack the intimate setting of a traditional restaurant. However, the vibrant energy of the surroundings adds a unique charm, aligning with the quick-service nature while the flavors of the food take center stage.**Overall Impression:** KOSHI stands out as a hidden gem within the Columbus food scene, serving authentic and flavorful JjamPpong that leaves a lasting impression. Despite its modest setting, the quality of the dishes and top-notch service elevate the dining experience, making it a must-visit spot for Korean cuisine.","Washington, DC",0,43,1811

It was mild spicy and more towards the salty-sweet side. Tteokbokki- soft rice cake, fish cake and egg in spicy sauce. It's not spicy, in that your mouth isn't burning, but the spice will starts to kick in later and you can feel it in your throat. The sauce is also not thick and sticky.

I've had the Carmella, and that is one massive, delicious sandwich or sub. Really a large sub. Very loaded with different meats. I think so far my favorite is the Money Penny, with pastrami.

The strawberry milkshake tasted very artificially flavored and I'm not a huge fan of tempeh, which was used as the ""meat""/protein for some of the things we ordered, like the Nashville hot chikn pizza. (On the menu it seemed like it was in several things) But otherwise that pizza and also  vrunch wrap were pretty good. Being completely honest, the Chicago Diner is way better than this place. Sorry just being honest. But obviously if you are in Columbus you can't go to the Chicago diner so you would come to this place instead.","Columbus, OH",105,434,795

The vibe was really relaxing and nice - I loved the lower lighting and being able to see the open hearth. The seating was comfortable and it just felt like a cozy place to be on a cold, windy night. My dining companion had the market steak, which he enjoyed. He chose the broccolini for his side (but sides are enough to share). I chose the chicken under a brick with the red beans and barley for my side. We would've been good with one side between both of us, but it was our first time here and we wanted to sample. He stuck to water, but I had the smoked old fashioned (I'm sure you're starting to notice a theme if you read multiples of my reviews lol). It was great. You get dinner and a show because the server smokes it table side. Service was friendly and prompt. Reservations are recommended if you want to sit in the main dining area. We sat by the bar, which we kind of dig in general. We are likely going to eat here again prior to COSI After Dark next month, too.

The available 0arking seemed to be street parking or valet. The restaurant was lively, festive, and fun. The flame grill in the back was a cool sight! We booked a reservation and was shown to our seats pretty quickly.We got the Full Chicken Under a Brick, which comes on top of bread. The chicken itself was juicy, not dry, and the sauce was an herby garlic sauce. The chicken itself wasn't seasoned as well but it was a well made chicken and I really liked the pickled radish on top. The bread was very good, crispy and airy.The Crispy Wings were delicious. They were seasoned pretty well, juicy, and I enjoyed the sauce that it came with. The sauce was tangy, spicy, and paired well with the crisp of the wings.The Smoked Chicken Sandwich was good, but also lacked a bit of something. The bread was crispy and airy. Overall, I would say it was also a well made dish.My favorite dish was the Garlic Loaded Fries. They were crispy, salty, garlicy, and made very well. I think the fries were probably my favorite dish.I also ordered the Firing Squad drink. The hibiscus drew me in, but the drink was a bit too strong with alcohol. Not a bad thing if you don't mind. I did enjoy the little surprise of what I think was cinnamon that it had, it was a good drink!Our server was fantastic and attentive. We were taken care of and our server made sure to explain the menu and also refilled our water often. All staff we encountered were nice and so kind!Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and restaurant. I think the food was good, but I would say something was missing from each dish. I think overall, I would come back and try other dishes and drinks.

So I was so happy during the last restaurant week that someone agreed to come with me! First, as everyone knows, it's beautiful inside. We had a lovely table by the window. We started with cocktails that were delicious. Was so happy that the waiter- who was incredible- basically told us what to order (I'm vegetarian and gluten intolerant) and the choices were amazing! The appetizer I got - Sweet Potato Chaat- was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Will definitely be back for that. My main dish - the stuffed Indian eggplant- was also good, but not as amazing at the chaat. My dinner partner liked his meal too and also agreed that he would come back (and remember, he's not an Indian food fan). Service was exceptional and really helped.

I have been to the rooh in Chicago a couple times when I lived there and thought that this Columbus one was wayy better overall!Food: 5/5! As the first course, we got the kheema and the shrimp, for the entree we got the nihari and the palak paneer, and for dessert we both got gulaab jamun with rabri. Everything was delicious!! The flavors were not muted down and the spices came through all the way. Nothing was overtly spicy just for the heck of it. I liked the Nihari the best - the meat fell of the bone seamlessly and the flavor reminded me of the Nihari I grew up eating in Bombay (I know!!). Drinks: I got the paan drink and it was SO good!

We were warming greeted by wait staff, and began to look over the menu.  This offerings were definitely elevated Indian food.First time I dine at an Indian establishment, I order butter or tikka chicken in order to gauge the kitchen - this hit the mark for me!

The truffle mushroom kulcha was one of my favorites.

The cauliflower Manchurian (crispy cauliflower fritters) were really good. For the main dish, we had the paneer pinwheel as well as the butter chicken. The paneer pinwheel had a good gravy, but I wasn't crazy about the butter chicken gravy- it was mediocre. We also had this other kofta dish with spinach gravy which was pretty good.

On one hand, the butter chicken is incredible (usually). This time is was off for some reason. A couple of my bites of chicken tasted freezer burned. It really ruined my favorite dish. Usually this dish is off the charts. I also got a shrimp appetizer that was way too salty. The food just wasn't as good tonight. Here are a couple other issues that would elevate my dining experience. Downer 1: Nothing to drink if you don't want alcohol or sugar drinks. I ordered ice tea and was offered lemonade or hot tea with some ice. Many of us don't drink soda or high sugar drinks/cocktails. It would be nice to have an option like ice tea.Downer 2: They push a QR Code menu. Unfortunately, my phone never gets reception in this restaurant. I have 4 bars but no website will load when in this restaurant. They offered me to connect to their WIFi but I don't link to public Wi-Fi. Finally they brought me a paper menu. We should have done that in the first place. A nice higher end dining establishment should push us to be on our phones when out to eat with friends. This spot has so much potential. I want to like it more, but there are a handful of things that just made tonight disappointing. I've had better experiences here, tonight just wasn't one of them.Downer 3: Overpriced for what you get. I think the price point could come down a bit.","Columbus, OH",34,225,1411

So, tonight I'm doing a solo dining experience. The staff have been friendly and knowledgeable in helping me navigate the menu. While I pondered my options, I ordered up one of their many unique cocktails. Under Paan Clouds was delicious! However, at these high prices for the tiny glass it came in, I'll be stopping at one drink tonight. I asked the waitress which items on the menu were a ""must-try"", and she recommended the Sweet Potato Chaat (I wouldn't order this again) and the Butter Chicken. Let me tell you this Butter Chicken was off the charts good!! This tender chicken was bathing in this velvety, flavorful sauce. Wow!The ambiance was soft lighting, clean, simple and nice. I didn't really feel the decor matched the creativity and scale of the menu. Prices of the menu items didn't match the decor of the space. There was a disconnect for me. Service was good. I felt attended to and valued as a customer. Sometimes when you're a solo diner it's easy to feel neglected.I didn't feel that here.My takeaway from this experience...excellent creative dishes and the best butter chicken on the planet! One of the best dishes I've had in a while. Creative cocktails that are unfortunately way OVER PRICED! I will definitely be back to try other things on their menu. I'll just skip the drinks.","Columbus, OH",7,72,1516

The blue cheese chips shareable they feature was good, but the rest of the meal was disappointing. We hoped get the Sunday special Beef Stroganoff, but they ran out by 7:00pm. This caused a pivot to the meatloaf which was plain, just like the mashed potatoes, broccoli, onion rings and BBQ gravy it was served with. I'll give credit for the nice sized portion, though. My wife got the BBQ chopped chicken salad which was nothing to speak about. Cap City has some good looking desserts, but we not inspired to try any based on the quality of what we had so far.

Please see my notes below: Pinot Noir - Love! Complimentary Rolls - These were cold and stale. Warm Pretzel & Cheese - The pretzel was hard and chewy (not a fan). We were fans of the beer cheese fondue, but not fans of the honey mustard sauce! Old Bay Shrimp Cocktail - While I appreciated that the shrimp were large and plump in size, I did not appreciate the large amount of Old Bay Seasoning that covered the shrimp. Once I removed the majority of the seasoning that covered the shrimp, I did enjoy the shrimp with the house made cocktail and louie sauces that were served with the shrimp! Cap City Diner Meatloaf - First, let's start with the menu description: ""Buttermilk-chive mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, broccoli, chili onion rings, and BBQ gravy"". The description excludes the super thick piece of bread that is located at the bottom of this dish which is then mounted with an insane amount of mashed potatoes and then topped with the meatloaf and BBQ gravy. While I enjoyed the flavors of the wild mushrooms, broccoli, meatloaf, and BBQ gravy - I did not enjoy the flavor and temperature of the mashed potatoes. They were super chunky and lukewarm. I wish that I could say that I enjoyed this dish, but I did not. I think that without the thick piece of bread at the bottom and with a smaller portion of ""whipped"" mashed potatoes - this dish would be really good!

The baked beans was a little bit better but I didn't finish them either.Finally, the service, on the surface, was very friendly and the waitress did check on me four different times after getting my food,  but it was all a front for a thinly disguised annoyed attitude.

I probably ate $20 worth of brisket alone! The sides aren't included, but range around $4, with mac and cheese being $7. The Mac and cheese was okay. Nothing special. Could be taken up a notch somehow maybe with onions or peppers? I'm not sure! Was lacking a wow factor. The meat was good! My favorite was the brisket and wings. My least favorite was the sausage because it came out cold. I was so full from everything else, I didn't bother asking for another one. I do wish you could try every sauce option they have. They unfortunately only let you chose two for free. We watched a table order the nachos, and they were HUGE. Definitely on our list when we come back. The crowd was a mix of all age and is more food focused during the day. At night when it's more of a bar - it's a young and energetic crowd. If you were drinking , they have some fun party and group drinks to try. Definitely give Bristol a try!

Ketchup came in packets on the side so I could put as much or as little as I wanted to my desire. Caesar salad 2/5- This was a little sad and can skip. The lettuce leaves were really chopped up, croutons weren't the greatest and caesar dressing was nothing special. I liked that the dressing came on the side though!

"Goodale Station","https://www.yelp.com/biz/goodale-station-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Carmen G.",3,"2023-12-21","A beautiful restaurant but could use some updates with their menu. Came here for dinner with my colleagues and upon entering, it's confusing where to go as you'd need to take an elevator up to the restaurant. There was no signage outside for you to know if you're in the right place. Took a guess and we actually ended up at the restaurant - yay. The service is good with our server being very attentive, however the food really needs some work imo. Started off with a cocktail that had babies breath for garnish. Babies breath is toxic to humans and should not be used in food, so I was quite surprised to see that my drink came with a whole bunch of it. The drink itself was good, so no complaints with taste.Charcuterie 5/5- This was a great platter for sharing and had a huge variety of different cheese ranging from sharp to soft, pickles, jams etc. They could've provided more crackers but nonetheless, this was great! Duck pasta 2/5- This is what caught me by surprise. I thought my duck pasta would come in some sort of sauce but unfortunately it was a complete miss for me. It came in this soupy base and had white beans in it as well which was weird in texture and flavour. I ended up picking out each white bean individually which left me with about half the dish to eat. The taste was also nothing spectacular, it truly tasted like chicken noodle soup. Such an odd dish that sounded so great, but unfortunately was not for me. The vibes and views are great here, but could use an update to their menu and drink practices.","Greater Toronto Area, Canada",687,286,1533

It was also a really beautiful view of the moon rising, and I just know that sunset would be amazing here too!Second, the drinks. They had a really interesting drink menu that had a bunch of fun concoctions. I went a little basic and got an amaretto sour, but it was still tasty. I would love to explore their drink menu more.Third, the appetizers. They had a good little menu of appetizers and Shareables. We split the charcuterie board between four people and it was the perfect amount to eat before dinner. It had a few different types of cheeses, nuts, spreads, and meat. I would like to note that some of the cheeses may have been sitting out too long. There were a few bites where it was just a little too hard. Fourth, dinner. Now, this is where I think they fell short (and the reason for my three star review). They have a small dinner menu which tends to mean that the options are very specialized and delicious. That was not the case here. it took me a while to decide, but I eventually decided on the cauliflower and it was described as if it was going to be a curry. Instead, it came out with a curry sauce spread in between. It was also massive pieces of cauliflower, similar to cauliflower steaks. not exactly what I expected according to the menu description. The flavor was just not the best either, it had a lot of lentils, which I don't mind, but the cauliflower steaks were too large to truly get the flavor everywhere and resulted in some thing that was on the Blander side and let your mouth go dry. after seeing what my companions got, I'm not sure if I would even attempt to get a dinner option here again.The service, however, was excellent. Our server was always quick to check on us and make sure we had what we needed.Overall: i'd recommend coming with friends, getting drinks and apps, and watching the sunset!","Louisville, KY",443,112,1977

We arrived right on time and the staff was absolutely amazing from the jump. That is one of the main reasons I would come back.. On top of the great views, of course. And after our visit, that's what would make me return.. Unfortunately not the food. We started with a charcuterie board and some cocktails. The drinks came out looking super photogenic, as did the charcuterie board. The board included super crunchy crostinis (hard to chew), a pate, some jam, nuts, and three types of cheese. One of the cheese options was so hard that we couldn't even cut it with a knife without extreme force. One of the staff members that came and took our plates confirmed and honestly, it just wasn't enjoyable to eat. On to the entrees.. No one at our table was super pleased with what we got. I went with the vadouvan cauliflower which was legit, a giant head of cauliflower cut into fours on top of a lentil salad, herbs, cut up citrus and a few other things. Once I really dug into it the flavors were there, but a head of cauliflower was definitely not what I expected.. The others ordered the duck and expected pasta of some sorts because that's what the menu said.. Instead it was more like a soup. We skipped dessert. As I mentioned from the jump, the staff was incredible and I would totally return for the views and drinks, but I'll skip the food until they change up the menu.","Columbus, OH",3866,1285,1557

We got to be there during a storm and the storm was crazy, but the views were beautiful. Perfect in the evening and on cloudy days. Food: We tried a bunch of their menu items. We got: szechuan beef, aloo masala, burger + fries, salmon, caesar salad with chicken, and Korean garlic bread. I'm still not sure why it's called Korean garlic bread when there's nothing Korean about it unless you pay extra to add kimchi. It was a decent sized garlic bread filled with cream cheese though. The caesar salad was delicious, but it was overdressed for my liking and to add chicken it's $8, making it a $20 salad which is overpriced to me. At least the chicken wasn't dry! I enjoyed the szechuan beef and aloo masala. Their fries remind me of McDonald's fries, but just crispier!Drinks: We got the Manix Pixie, Abnormal Nectar, spicy marg, and Tokyo Tea (Mocktail). Good cocktails and it's priced higher than usual, but it is a rooftop bar. The mocktail was delicious, but $9 to not have alcohol in it was steep.  Service: LOVED our waiter. He was efficient and so kind to us. He checked in quite often and even offered to take our group picture on their patio area.

It is located on the top floor of the Canopy Hilton hotel, and the rooftop gives some pretty awesome views of the city. I was weary about parking, so we Ubered. We went for brunch on a Sunday and it wasn't crowded at all. The bartender was excellent, we each got an espresso martini and shared the tacos (chorizo, scrambled eggs, salsa, cotija cheese, shredded lettuce). They came out quickly and were delicious. They come with a side of potatoes and chicharrones and we enjoyed the crunch of the chicharrones. The inside is swanky and there are several different areas to sit for small or large parties. It was an open air set up when we went which added to the ambience of the rooftop setting. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Goodale Station and will now add it to the short list of places we plan to take friends who are visiting from out of town. I will say, the cocktail prices are a bit steep for Columbus (espresso martini was $18), however the brunch cocktails were more reasonable (around $10).

It has a dark serial killer movie theme and if a cannibalistic murder came here, she would be in sicko heaven with eating patrons and employees who have less gristle and fat in their blood.First things first... parking!  It's in an odd tiny block and if you're lucky, you'll find a spot right out front.  Make sure you practice your parallel parking before you go.  There is parking in the rear, but it may be more off to the side in a tiny lot that says ""Reserved Parking"".  It doesn't say ""Reserverd for Seitanists"" or anything like that, so check with them to make sure you're parking in the right place.I saw they have a Gyro, and unlike what Tina Turner sang once ""We don't need another Gyro"", we actually do.  The ""meat"" on this one was actually flavorful.  The pita was fresh and the toppings and tzatziki were also pretty good.For a side, I had the Baked Potato Salad which was cold potatoes with a mayo based creamy sauce and green onions and other flavors of a baked potato.  This could have used a bacon element and maybe I'll bring those pink McCormick Bacony Bits with me next time (those are also vegan friendly)The woman at the counter recommended the Beef and Cheddar (was a take on Arby's) or the Cheese Steak and on a future visit, these will be on my list.Also 10 Stars for having Coke products.

The subs are good but not great, but the restaurant itself makes me want to revisit. Although this is a franchise, the personality of the interior makes it feel like a smaller business. It's brightly colored with music decor all around and has a variety of seating options. My experience with service was kind, knowledgeable, and attentive to my questions but pretty slow both times. The menu is vast, including multiple vegetarian options. I've tried a tuna sub (can't remember which one), the Crazy Dave Sub, and Dave's Peace Steak Sub. I would recommend all but the last one; maybe it was just my sub, but it was packed with meat with too little topping and sauce, and the meat itself wasn't seasoned, only the top. It was also cut so finely that it was very soft and textured, in a way that I didn't like personally. The famous Cosmic Sauce is good, sort of like a thin ranch sauce but you'd have to try it yourself to understand the flavor. The bread is also always fresh and toasted to perfection.Overall, I'd recommend a dine-in experience for some unique subs and decor, but not if you're wanting something quick.","Columbus, OH",16,166,1288

It's fast casual Mediterranean, but the experience is a little more upscale than that. The food is fancier, the service is a little better. I got a daily special, spicy Tunisian chicken stew. It's not spicy. It is seasoned, and there's a tiny bit of heat. Of course I like heat, so it might be a little more spicy for some people. Very heavily seasoned, tasty broth, with big chunks of tender chicken, plus tomatoes, carrots, olives etc. Came with perfect rice, some pickled veggies, a very good green salad, and pita. It seemed a little expensive until I ate it, and was absolutely stuffed when I was done. Excellent quality, plenty of quantity. Plus I got a tiny piece of pistachio baklava, which was also excellent.

Their website is extremely easy to navigate, and you can place an order for pick up right through the site, selecting ""pay at the store"" so you don't have to put a credit card down up front. I went with the 'Devil went down to Georgia' sandwich and a bag of balsamic vinegar chips. The sandwich comes with turkey, jalapenos, cole slaw, pepperjack cheese & diablo sauce rye bread. It was ready right when I got there, 10-15 minutes after the order was placed. The inside is quaint, but has limited seating. There are some picnic tables outside.The sandwich had a huge portion of deli meat, and the jalapenos gave it a nice kick. I wasn't able to taste the coleslaw, so it was probably either a very small portion or just overshadowed by the hefty amount of turkey. The diablo sauce was really good though. Side note, by the time I drove back to work to eat it (~10 minutes), the bread was a bit soggy, but if I would've eaten it right away that probably would not have been the case. Lastly, the balsamic vinegar chips were a bit disappointing. They were all vinegar with little to no balsamic flavor. The chips are from a company called ""Carolina Kettle"" though so I can't knock Newfangland as they don't make them. Overall the sandwich was alright, however at $12.50 for only a sandwich and below average chips (no drink), this place gets 3 stars in my book.","Columbus, OH",460,380,1449

The melted cheese and mustard sauce was awesome. The bartender also gave me some fresh horseradish on the side which was a nice kick! My bill (I didn't drink) was 15.

Naturally she recommended the pot roast, which I think is the only thing i have ever ordered here.  Anyway, I decided to go for anything else this time.  I chose the garbage mac, which was not very good and made me regret my choice.  It had excessive amounts of cheese and i would recommend against it for anyone considering.

Maybe. Great food, great dive-bar atmosphere, and cheep beer? Definitely. Tip Top, located on the most beautiful single stretch of street in downtown Columbus (why they don't do this everywhere defies logic) is/was the go-to spot for after work happy hours or pre/post-show dinner. Specializing in a nice menu of sandwiches to go with an ice cold beer (or cocktail), Tip Top is not only easy on the budget but tasty too. This is more of a jeans and t-shirt place but if you walked in after the ballet in a suit and tied you wouldn't get a second look either, which to me screams great dive bar. If you happen to swing by during happy hour which is Monday -Friday, Ohio draft beers are $3 (yea in 2023) and they have a smashing $5 beef (I think it's beef?) nacho that is sure to satisfy.","Columbus, OH",37,159,839

This location, abutting a Kohl's store, has ample parking. However, the patio area peers out into that sea of cars, so focus on the food, drink, and friends. If you come during a big, in-town sporting event like Ohio State football gamedays, even this cavernous place can be full, so plan accordingly. Carry out is available, so if you don't get a seat, at least get some goodies to go. The fun quotient here is high, and the happy hour pricing is reasonable.

Ordering was easy and wait was short. We got the tonkotsu and Kara kapow. The noodles in both were good and the Kara kapow was pretty flavorful. The tonkotsu flavor wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It somehow didn't have the deep fatty richness of other tonkotsu we've had (tbf one experience was in Japan) and the meat was over cooked. They also put pickled ginger inside the bowl which normally I like but because the soup lacked depth, the ginger overpowered the broth.The worst part about our meal (at least to me) was that we had to listen to the employees talk smack about customers for most of our meal. We sat two seats from the register and there was someone the workers knew in the first seat.

We all tried several options. The food was really good. It wasn't the best, but certainly better than a few other places we've gone to. It was within walking distance of the convention center so it was convenient as well. You can pick your spice level, but we kept forgetting to. My group had the veggie shoyu bowl, vegan veggie shoyu bowl, chicken paitan bowl, veggie abura soba, and a few pork ones. The ramen broth was pretty flavorful, but some seasoning sank so a bit hard to drink. The soba was brothless, but had enough sauce on the bottom for the last few bites to be powerful. The tofu was good and soft. I wish the hot spring egg had been warm or hot, but it was still tasty. The bowls are paper so eco friendly, but the spoons are plastic. Servings were really hearty and one friend said he'd eat there daily if he lived closer. It is pretty pricey though.

I tried the food upstairs of the building (North Market) but the noodles were already getting clumpy so I recommend eating there and not take it home.Paitan: fried chicken was ok and the broth didn't have much flavor.Miso: a bit oily but the broth was flavorful and fishy (in a good way-smelled and tasted a nice aroma of fish). Pork was good, too, I wish it was a bit thicker.Aburasoba: this was my least favorite. This is brothless ramen but there is some sauce on the bottom.

My server was apologetic, saying there was some confusion about the tables.I originally chose pickle chips as my appetizer. After another 15-20 minutes, I received food that looked, smelled & tasted burnt. The server tried to return them, but the kitchen staff said they were cooked correctly (they were dark because of the new oil being used) & made her bring them back to the table. She apologized again & brought an order of pretzel bites. They were OK - crispy, not soft, with a thick cheese ""sauce"" & yummy buffalo ranch.Due to the long wait, I had to get the rest of the meal to go. I ordered the steakhouse burger with fries & buckeye pie. The server asked how I wanted the burger cooked & I requested medium, so I imagined a thick burger, pink inside. Instead, I received a dry, well-done burger thinner than many fast-food places serve. The A1 aioli was missing, making it even drier. I'm sure the fries would have been good fresh. I haven't tried the pie.The server was very good. She was kind & empathetic, and did the best she could to overcome the kitchen issues. She also took the beer off my tab when I was overcharged.

As stated in other reviews, the cocktails weren't necessarily strong but they score points for refreshing-ness. As for food, I was happy with the happy hour burger, bologna sandwich, ample Buffalo chicken dip and the appropriately named Best Dill Pickle Chips Ever. The Brussels Sprouts didn't hit the mark as they were too dry; they could've used more of the balsamic glaze listed in the description. The most exciting aspect of the Rail is that they had so many good looking burgers and bowls that weren't on the happy hour menu that truly makes us want to come back to explore.

Early afternoon, happy hour 3-6. Seated quickly and very friendly staff. Interior decor is cool, rustic industrial vibe. I opted for the restaurant week menu, this included choice of appetizer, main and dessert.  I started with the Pretzel bites. These were fried, which I found strange, but it was tasty, served with some sort of a spicy ranch and a cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was the best although it had a very very thick consistency. My main was the steakhouse burger, which was supposed to have an onion ring and an A1 based sauce with blue cheese. When it arrived, the onion ring was missing. I did opt of onion rings as a side, perhaps they figured i'd just place my own onion ring on the sandwich. The burger was thin and dry. I think they were going for a Smashburger vibe, but the execution reminded me more of McDonalds. The blue cheese overpowered the entire burger, and I was left with only that flavor. The onion rings were standard, seemed like frozen food service style versus a hand breaded in house. Lastly was the buckeye pie. The pie itself was good, but very rich. It had crunchy pieces of toffee inside which was a surprise as I bit into what seemed to be a silky-smooth pie and CHRUNCH...unexpected & very contrasting textures, threw me off for a minute. The pie filling was peanut butter, and it was very dense. The crust was extremely hard, to the point that it was very difficult to cut. I had higher expectations.","Pickerington, OH",16,336,1489

It's not blackened so clearly overcooked or the oil hadn't been changed in awhile. Pretty basic side salad, which came out with the main dish.Waited awhile for refills despite having asked 2 people. The server came over right after the food was delivered, no one had the chance to taste it yet. Just asked if everything came out, which it had. The next time they came over was well over 10 minutes later, so the chicken was cold and that person was no longer interested in another dish. Still no refills.They took off the chicken sandwich but the bill was still $40 for 2 iced teas, the appetizer, and a lunch sized steak salad.Disappointed for sure.","Grand Rapids, MI",0,2,1375
"The Rail - Grandview Heights","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-rail-grandview-heights-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Jayme H.",4,"2023-03-22","A brand new location of The Rail has officially opened up in Grandview. Right off Dublin Rd, catercorner from Sheets. My boyfriend lives nearby and brought it to my attention. After checking out their happy hour specials, we decided to give it a go. $6 appetizers and cocktails. That's one helluva deal. We arrived to discover a pristine restaurant. It screamed, ""I'm brand new,"" from the moment we walked in the doors. We were seated right away, in a booth tucked away between the kitchen and the main dining room. After our server bought over waters we asked for recommendations and eventually landed on what to get. We started with the Sweet Peach Bourbon Tea cocktail. It wasn't very strong at all, but it was tasty. We later tried the Raspberry Mint Mule and another Strawberry cocktail but I can't find the name of it anywhere. All were good, but I liked the mule the most. Give it a try!As for food, my boyfriend ordered the burger and the bologna sandwich. I ordered a side salad, the Brussel sprouts, and we shared the house made tater tots. All in all it was alright. The salad was solid, hard to mess up. The tots were the biggest let down. I've had them house made before and these were just way too dense. I loved the Brussel sprouts. I just wish I got more of them. The majority of the plate was just crispy (almost burnt) outer pieces of sprouts. The boyfriend said both the burger and sandwich were good. All in all, we both agreed that we could come back, especially for happy hour. Welcome to the neighborhood!","Columbus, OH",3866,1285,1528

I called early ( around 12:15, they opened at 1 PM ) and the guy that answered the phone offered to start up the fryer early in order to make me a pork chop for lunch before I headed out of town. Now if that isn't customer service I don't know what is! I declined and actually just waited since I was so moved by the offer. The lady behind the counter was also extremely nice. So their customer service is top tier!Now for the bad : One Pork Chop and Two Pieces of Bread is $10! - that's way too expensive, I know inflation is crazy right now, but damn. Also if you order ahead over the phone you have to pay with credit card right then and there, I guess too many clowns have ordered and not picked up their meals. Also the taste of the pork chop was fresh, but weird. It taste as though they used the same batter that just put fish in, or fried fish in the same oil. It was just really unpleasant. I had to finish it though. Can't let $10 go down the drain. Ha Side note, be prepared to eat in your car or at home.

Every restaurant I try, just seems to be average and nothing great. I have a lot to say about the food and the services. First let me discuss the poor service we received. My significant other and I made a reservation at 7:00 pm and were not seated until 7:35 pm. We were completely ignored and not provided any updates or told sorry for your wait. When this has happened in the past at other restaurants, usually someone would ask if we wanted to order drinks or look at the menu. I was just surprised by the complete lack of trying from the staff. At 7:20 pm, I inquired why there were a bunch of open tables. They book all tables in their restaurant and will only seat 2 people at their small tables. I feel like to avoid having people wait I recommend they need to come up with a new system, since if this happens often they may be losing business. It just seemed like they had many open 4 seating tables that could have been used, but chose to make customers wait instead. Once we were seated service was average. There was no apology for the wait and the staff were neutral, not exactly pleasant.However, since I read the reviews, despite the poor service I was greatly looking forward to the food, which was subpar. I ordered the eggplant parmesan and wedding soup while my s/o ordered veal. Both of our dishes came with a side of spaghetti. The soup was probably one of the worst wedding soups I have tried. The broth was good, but the chicken bits they added to it were really dry. The eggplant was okay. It was thick (too much for my taste), but tender. The breading was nicely fried. However, they didn't put much cheese or sauce on the eggplant so it was a bit dry. The taste of the eggplant was also bitter and not the most pleasant. The spaghetti was al dente, but tasted like typical spaghetti I would buy from the store. It was tossed in sauce and was very plain. The sauce didn't have much flavor and tasted acidic. The veal was cooked well, but not that flavorful. It was breaded nicely and topped with a good amount of cheese and sauce.  Overall I'd say these dishes were rated around a 3. Lastly, for dessert, we ordered a cannoli. The shell was light and crispy. The filling had good flavor, but the texture was a little too runny. I do not plan to go back to this restaurant and was disappointed with my experience. Based on the cannoli I do plan on checking out their bakery. I hope that I will have better luck there.","Columbus, OH",426,235,2500

You're met with friendly staff and familial energy upon stepping in. While the tables and booths are close together, there are choiceful partitions to make your experience more intimate. The restaurant is decorated with European art, family photos and hand-painted Italian landscapes. You immediately notice the red and white tablecloths, akin to the ones you might see at a busy strip of restaurants in Rome.I had heard all about the meatballs so I knew that was a must order. I was set on ordering the spaghetti and meatballs but then saw the Giuseppe's sampler which would include that, eggplant parmesan, AND meatball lasagna. As someone who likes to try a little of everything, I could not pass up the sampler. Zach and I ordered that to share and coupled it with shrimp and lobster ravioli which is topped with a creamy sauce and more shrimp. While we enjoyed everything, I have to say the meatball lasagna was my favorite to my surprise! Of the three dishes in the sampler, I thought that was the one I would like third best but it came in first.We bookended our pastas with salads, which all come with house-made sauces, and the tiramisu. I wouldn't skip either of these courses, especially the tiramisu. The consistency was perfect, spongy but not too much. Rich in flavor but not overly sweet.Overall the food and value are both top notch (you'll probably have leftovers), and I quite enjoyed the ambiance. As a bonus, several of their wine pours were under $10. When you go, you'll want to book a reservation ahead of time given the restaurant size.","Columbus, OH",453,412,1601

The inside is so cute, they have red and white table cloths and lots of nods to Italy. The staff is also so kind and I was sat right away. For the food we ordered a bottle of red wine for the table, pasta fritto, bruschetta, and insalata caprese. The pasta fritto seemed a little strange to me but it was AMAZING. The caprese was also so flavorful and fresh. For my meal I ordered the chicken Marsala. The vegetable it came with that day was green beans they also were so delicious and fresh. The portion size of the chicken was HUGE and I was able to bring almost half of it home! It was some of the best Marsala I have ever had. For dessert we split tiramisu and carrot cake. I cant decide which was better they were both so amazing. The carrot cake was so flavorful and the tiramisu was fluffy and the best I've ever had. Can't say enough good things about the food!When the bill came I was shocked by how inexpensive it was. We ordered so much food, the portions were so large, and the pricing was so good!

From the moment you step inside, you are greeted with warm hospitality and an inviting ambiance that sets the tone for an enjoyable meal.One of the standout dishes at Lola and Giuseppe's is the daily special. We tried the Chicken Rosemary Penne. This delectable pasta dish is a perfect blend of flavors. The penne pasta is cooked to perfection, al dente, and tossed with tender pieces of chicken, fresh rosemary, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and a rich rosemary cream sauce. The combination of the aromatic rosemary and the savory chicken creates a truly satisfying dish that will leave you craving for more.Another must-try item on the menu is the Pasta Fritto. This unique appetizer consists of lightly fried pasta, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The pasta is seasoned with a delightful blend of herbs and spices, making it a flavorful and addictive treat. Served with a tangy marinara sauce for dipping, the Pasta Fritto is a delightful twist on a classic Italian dish.For those looking for a lighter option, Giuseppe's Salad is a refreshing choice. This vibrant salad combines fresh crisp romaine, perfect tortellini, juicy Roma tomatoes, provolone, and pesto-like dressing (basil and olive oil to be exact!). The combination of flavors and textures makes this salad the perfect accompaniment to any meal or a satisfying light meal on its own.To end your meal on a sweet note, the Cassata Cake is a must-try dessert. This traditional Italian cake is a symphony of flavors and textures. Layers of moist sponge cake are filled with sweet ricotta cheese, candied fruit, and a hint of citrus. Topped with a velvety icing, the Cassata Cake is a decadent treat that will satisfy any sweet tooth.Overall, Lola and Giuseppe's Trattoria is a gem.

I had to be a bit creative and park at the bank next door.  It was after hours and I was just running in to pickup an order, so the risk of being towed was minimal.  The dining room seems small, but I only stood at the door while the hostess retrieved my mobile order.  It seems like a good place for a date...intimate and homey, but not very small child friendly.I cannot say enough about the food.  I received a generous portion that was enough for dinner and lunch the next day.  I know good Italian, and THIS IS GOOD ITALIAN!  I'm glad I ordered an extra sauce as I was tempted to drink it with a straw.  It's certainly not out of a jar or can.  My veal was not fork tender, but easily cut with a knife.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the green beans were tender-crisp.  It came with a side of garlic bread which had the perfect amount of garlic...not enough to linger on your breath, but enough to enhance your meal.

The prickly pear sauce on it paired absolutely perfectly with the tuna. Just the amount of sweetness needed.The Flor de Calabaza was the most familiar dish. Reminiscent of a quesadilla with zucchini, but the pipian verde took it to a whole different level. While this is overall a dish with more mild flavors, the pipian verde is a deep earthiness and freshness that I've never tasted before.The Tikin Xic was the star of the show. This corvina was beautifully seasoned- nearly dry and crunchy on the outside and incredibly juicy on the inside. I could have eaten an entire fish cooked and spiced this way. I devoured this at an inappropriate speed, probably.The Tacos de Cachete were a fun family-style meal. The pork cheek was tender and flavorful, the the chicharrones were an amazing salty counterpart to the delicious pickled veggies. Side note, why aren't we pickling potatoes more often? Genius.The Seis Leches was a perfect desert. I never knew tres leches wasn't enough because apparently tres more leches really perfects this dish. The chamomile ice cream was floral and fresh, and the cake itself was sweet with a slightly less sweet whipped cream counterpart. Perfectly balanced.I only have amazing things to say.

In fact, she seemed to genuinely enjoy discussing the food. I loved learning that she helped create the Koji fermented lemon cocktail.

The honey latte somehow didn't hit the baristas screen and I had a tiny wait for it, but the moment it was brought to her attention she prioritized it and it came next... and, wowzers.... Worth the wait!  so no complaints on the tiny hiccup. The egg sandwich.  Omg it is 7 bucks!   A great value compared to the competition. The flavor of every element shines through and is worth mentioning.   The egg is light, fluffy, not crumbly so it doesn't flop out of the sandwich. The herbs they use in the egg is perfectly balanced and adds to the flavor vs overtaking the egg.  I swear I taste Creme Faiche.(which may be why I love this). The cheddar they used isn't too strong so it doesn't over take the egg. The candied bacon is cooked perfectly.  The fresh ciabatta bread is soft and not hard/chewy, so was the perfect choice to serve this sandwich.  Definitely,  is in the top ten of egg sandwiches I have ordered, ever.   A+ Sycamore.

Unfortunately I did not learn my lesson and ordered the Crown Jewel epic taco which also had the bland mac and cheese in it. Once I dug that out it was decent.

The overall aesthetic of the restaurant is fun and slightly upscale. I feel like you could go there for a nice dinner out, girls night, or something more casual. The gender neutral restrooms are great as they each have their own individual sink and mirror area. Also loved the Italian vibes of the music and decor. We started off with the Arancini which is amazing, as well as the bread. I got the Cacio de Pepe. My husband got a Caesar Salad and a cheese pizza. One thing to note is that it did not have sauce, which was different but still good. Everything was fantastic and our server Parker was also phenomenal.

However for the money I thought the portions and plating was very minimalistic. I felt it was overpriced for what you get. Everyone in our group left hungry. We were under wow'd. We ordered a Sicilian pizza to share as a starter. It was just ok. A few of us ordered the Braised Lamb Gnubi. It arrived on a big plate with 5 tiny Gnubi on a thin layer of sauce. Nothing special. The taste was just ok. Disappointed to be honest. I absolutely love Cameron Mitchell restaurants but this first experience here makes me unsure about being back.

Located in walking distance to the Mooney Parking Garage (free to park). The restaurant is packed tight with tables throughout. Very, very loud in the dining area and bar. We were lucky enough to get a table in the corner behind the bar, and it was very quiet. Facing out towards the bridge providing some great views. Ok, let's get back to the food and experience. The service and staff seemed very stressed and lacked compassion and details. Example, sat down at the table, and there were table settings that were removed, and too many were taken. It took several asks to finally get the extra place setting. One person ordered their cocktail, but the rest of the table didn't get a chance to get it in before the server walked away. That set the tone for the entire less than steller experience. Bathrooms are co-ed and towards the back of the restaurant after walking past small pathways in between tables. The bathroom was not clean, but a lot of individual rooms provided more privacy. The main dining area and bar seemed loud and not quaint or private if that is what you would expect. The food. Okay, this is a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, and only the best is what I expect. The food flavors and execution were spot on. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. I left satisfied. The prices and quality met its match. The espresso martini was cold and perfectly shaken to a crisp, stiff cocktail of pure deliciousness. Highly recommended. I can't put my finger on it, but I wasn't wowed, and I need to experience it again, and then I can truly get a good review out. The thing is, I am not sure I would be craving to go back anytime soon.","Columbus, OH",242,295,1685

Great addition to the area! The bread was salty, light and amazing I could have ate so much of that. Great menu, wanted to try multiple items but heard to try the arancini and it did not dissapoint. Great flavor and texture, would love to have it again. Was torn between getting pasta or the pizza, everything looked amazing online, after finally deciding I went with the porcini & truffle pizza and it was so full of flavor and strong taste of truffle so if you love those flavors you will love this pizza. I could only eat a couple slices after being full and it reheats very well in air fryer or microwave! I would have gave the restaurant a 5 star but we didn't have the best service, our waitress was not very attentive, it was Valentine's Day so maybe I can give her the benefit of the doubt but still shouldn't be to much of an issue to refill water which we had to ask for because she didn't do it.

When looking at the two tops next to us, the couples looked crammed and could overhear each other's conversations.Our server was very friendly and punctual. Her knowledge of the menu was pretty good but she didn't seem too invested in getting my wife exactly what she wanted.The Sicilian pizza had incredible flavor and the crust was some of the best I've ever had, however the crust in the middle just left my pizza flopping all over the place. Our desert came out for free due to our birthdays which was a great touch. The spumoni sundae (chocolate cake) came out and was massive. I enjoyed the subtle flavor but it was just too dry to enjoy. The homemade whipped cream though was some of the best I've ever had!All in all, we had a good experience but I'll never be back. We got lucky with the seating and I know a two top would have been irritating. I just kind of thought for the price I'd be a bit more impressed with the entire experience.

I absolutely loved my experience this week during restaurant week. I made a reservation for four of us and we were seated a high top. Our waitress was very nice but overdid it a tad with calling us friends. For restaurant week it was 3 courses for $35 and they were all amazing. Well first off the bread was so yummy with oil, red pepper flakes and parmigiana cheese. I got Caesar salad for my first course. It came with Romaine, Focaccia Croutons, Creamy Lemon Garlic Dressing, Parmigiano Reggiano. My main course was by far my favorite and I got to try my step dad's meatball as pictured below. I got Chicken Parmesan with House-made Rigatoni, Alfredo, Marinara. It was so yummy and I would get it every time I come back but want to try so many more items. The meatball was huge but not my favorite. I definitely prefer the Chicken Parmesan. The biggest surprise for me was how good the Brûléed Lemon Tart with Blueberry Sauce was. I didn't expect that combination to be so complementary. I definitely recommend it if you were looking for something sweet and tart.

The house biscuits served with the soup make it the perfect comfort snack.

It was very awkward encounter and when I ordered chips and salsa, it became weirder. I don't think it's unusual for a group to come and get one drink then go somewhere else. The salsa however was not very good and the chips kind of stale. It's a very pretty restaurant and should be more popular as it's in the arena district but it's missing some things.

The food is always on point and I have tried many dishes/sides. The enchiladas, the caramelized cauliflower tacos (with garlic whipped goat cheese!) , and the kreeper sauce are a few to highlight. Also a little tip- they have fried plantains on the kids menu that used to be on the normal menu.. tossed in Tajin and our server recommended a chipotle dipping sauce. Absolutely delicious. And the drinks are mouthwatering. I really enjoy the Chile-mango marg. Great place to go for a nice dinner or even lunch on an idle Tuesday.

Make sure you don't eat here when there is an event at the Arena. When we arrived to park it was a madhouse. Kids and families were all arriving to enjoy Disney on ice. Parking was $22. What was I thinking?!!Beside that one horrible start to the evening, everything went amazing from there! Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Since it was our first time, she offered us to try her favorites. She sold them so well, we just had her surprise us. We had some chips and salsa (wow those chips were crunch delicious) and ceviche to start. So good. Then we had the enchiladas with a side of street corn. Wow! Everything was so good!

I wanted something that tasted just as good as Zankou Chicken (my all time FAVORITE!). I was very happy with this chicken shawarma wrap! BIT next time, I will order my wrap a little bit differently.The most important part for me is the chicken and toum. Theirs is excellent! The chicken was well seasoned and had some of the nice crispy edges from being on the rotisserie. Also their pita bread is really thin, so I don't get full on just bread (this is truly appreciated). The only thing that threw me off was that I was not expecting iceberg (or maybe it was romaine?) lettuce in the wrap. I'm not one who likes hot lettuce, since it wilts then takes on an odd flavor & texture. I didn't see lettuce in the description online when I ordered.What would make this PERFECT for me would be to put chopped tomato in place of the lettuce and getting a side of the homemade pickled turnips.

Only $4 each.The first time was with friends. One caveat is that the booth we sat in seemed small and the seat wasn't secured to the frame. I felt like our knees were almost touching, which was kinda too intimate for me.The food was great. I had moussaka, it was good but different than what I expected. Basically, it's an eggplant sauce over saffron rice or vermicelli and salad. Everyone else enjoyed their food.I noticed there was a separate room that you can reserve for a party, which seats 30. Nice to keep that in mind for the future.On my second visit I tried the three different flavors of fatayer: cheese, spinach, and meat. This is a middle eastern savory pie served as a finger food.

I was prepared for elegance and carefully sourced ingredients, artfully mastered with passion, creativity, and care - in a beautiful space run by a friendly, professional, hard-working team........and still the evening was beyond my wildest imagination! From Napoleon's wizardry and irresistible enthusiasm the moment we entered the street level bar to the dusting of Holy Basil on the shaved ice and cream dessert, my son and I enjoyed a magical evening of amazing food and service! We devoured the three spreads and homemade naan - perfect with a mocktail,  after a long drive from Raleigh.  It was followed up with a sword of succulent quail, albeit more ""gamey"" than I prefer. On my daughter, Emma's insistence, we were brought a citrus salad. We experienced flavors of orange I never knew existed, while leaves of dehydrated beet infused with subtle smoky aromas came together like a bright sunrise.Emma works as a server, so we were given a tour of the downstairs dining room with its chefs busy at the fire, and the more intimate bar off to the side. A feeling of relaxation, adventure, and warmth rose up in me. Hiraeth is gorgeous and casual, fine and cozy all at the same time.Back upstairs we ordered liquid art in the form of a rum punch and feasted on my new favorite poultry dish ever; Jerk Guinea Hen. Served with an array of deliciously crafted root vegetables, the hen smelled divine. It was juicy and tender with a seasoning of herbs and spices that delivered just the right amount of heat. Turnip pancake and yucca hashbrowns sound strange, but tasted so good. As much as I loved it, we needed a ""to go"" box; a welcome paperboard shaped like an ice cream carton, simple and compostable. Full and satisfied, we barely managed room for the perfect desert. Shaved apple ice with cream brought up childhood memories of snow cream. Light and refreshing as a clear winter day, it left us happy and invigorated. As a special occasion destination, I couldn't think of a better place! I'd love to come back and try the fish and the hoppin' john. Congratulations to the team for pulling it all together and for the well deserved James Beard nomination! Thank you all for a memorable evening!","Brentwood, Brentwood, NC",0,1,2235

If just two, I think the bar seating gives you a great view of the food preparation and actually sits at the same level of a table.Of our meal, the steak and lemongrass pork were the standouts both being incredibly juicy and flavorful. The creamy mustard sauce on the steak was fantastic as well. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the beef fat potatoes - not that they were bad, but just not really unique. The jerk guinea hen was deliciously spicy, but just not up to the same flavor as the other dishes.Service was friendly and efficient and was great in describing dishes and cocktails.Bottom line, I would recommend Hiraeth, though I must admit, I'm a bigger fan of their sister restaurant, Chapman's Eat Market.","Columbus, OH",276,158,840

We went with an Old Fashioned & later a glass of orange natural wine.  Food was amazing, nice sized small plate portions. The salad was so great & honestly huge.

Lucky to have a reservation early on in their opening. I am guessing they will be hard to come by moving forward. Had a warm welcome upon entry and were escorted to a table downstairs near the kitchen which was wonderful. It wasn't overly noisy which was surprising and nice. Our server was great answering questions and helping us make our choices. As mentioned in other reviews, they do ask you to order everything at once (minus dessert). This was no issue in my mind l. Food came out in a well timed sequence. All together we ordered 6 dished none of which were large cut items.All of our food times were tasty.  I really enjoyed the Naan with dips though it does only come with 1 piece of Naan. The portion is definitely off with the amount of dip provided.  You are able to order extra Naan but at least 2 pieces would make sense. The longanisa was wonderful and I'd definitely order that again. The carrots were fine but not my favorite.  Corn was tasty but could have been warmer when arriving to the table. The Greek salad was a large portion full of flavor. The hanger steak was at the top of my list. The accompanying broccollini was amazing. Really didn't notice the  potato crispies with this dish.We were able to try all 3 desserts. The corn creme brulee was better than I anticipated though got a bit sweet. No way to go wrong with the chocolate semifreddo. The 3rd was a seasonal french cantaloupe shaved ice and Panna cotta was not to my taste but we all can't like everything.Cocktail, wine, beer, etc. Is plentiful in choices and varieties. Would I come here often, unfortunately my wallet would not support that, but special occasions it's a definite must.","Columbus, OH",49,140,1751

And if you book the right time and place, you'll get to watch all of this cooked right in front of you in a fantastic chef's kitchen with wood tossed on the fire and food sizzling and cooking creating an experience rivaling any great movie or theatre performance. We had the opportunity to attend during opening weekend at the Chef's table and had one of the best meals and culinary experiences that Columbus has to offer. Every dish was charming and cooked to perfection. While we had the opportunity to sample a few different dishes, surprisingly the naan and dips really stood out to us above all else. Maybe we are just naan lovers but we enjoyed it enough to get a second serving. The staff are extremely polite and professional, becoming of what one of Columbus's up and coming premier restaurant experiences would require. Sitting at the chef's table we also had the chance to meet BJ, owner and head chef. Fantastic guy.

Starting of with the drinks- The Password is ""Caprese"" caught my eye because I like savory drinks- the scotch scared me a little but this drink was fabulous. It tasted like a fresh tomato! The Longanisa was very good, but it is just rice. Is it the one of most interesting flavors I have ever experienced in rice? Yes. But, it is a $19 bowl of rice with about 2 servings in it. I was under the impression it would have crab or tomatoes in it but that was just what it was cooked in, i guess. The fried fish was very good, it wasn't too heavy and I loved the sauce, herb salad, and tomatoes with it. The roasted potatoes hurt me to say, but if given these potatoes at a cookout, i probably wouldn't eat them. They were WAY too acidic, everyone at the table agreed. Skip the potatoes! Super disappointing. We had a starter salad and the greek salad which were both very good. I loved the feta in the greek salad. I'm blanking on what it was called, but the chocolate dessert we had was also outstanding. Super rich and decadent. In terms of the atmosphere, Hiraeth is gorgeous. However, I would love to sit upstairs next time. The basement is LOUD. The four of us were yelling in order to hear each other and we practically gave up on talking at some point.

As we walked up she was staring at her phone and it took me a couple tries of asking if they were serving dinner before she looked up and curtly answered yes.  The menu was really limited compared to what it said online but we were hungry so were like whatever.We sat down with my service dog under the table and ordered drinks. As the bartender walked back to our table with the drinks, he barked. Rare he does this, and as much as I dislike it when he acts up, he quickly quieted down and I don't blame him because we've been traveling all day. The ADA allows people to train their own service dogs, because they're expensive. I'm not a perfect trainer and no service dog is perfect anyhow; I have a friend who got one from a professional organization and the dog kept him up at night, barking at cars and noises. They can also be specifically trained to bark, to signal people. Point being they're live animals and lots of situations can throw them off, it's hard to prepare for. The ADA specifically states that if a service animals misbehavior (yes, it's specifically addressed in the law, because IT HAPPENS EVEN WITH REAL SERVICE ANIMALS) is disrupting other patrons, you must get a chance to address their misbehavior, which I did. Not to mention we were literally the only people in the whole place. So he stops barking (did so twice) and I apologize. He would never ever bite anyone - barking a little or jumping up on occasion is about as bad as his behavior gets. He's still lying down under the table this whole time. The bartender then sarcastically states, ""Oh that's weird, because real service dogs NEVER bark!"" Then explained angrily that she is afraid of dogs that bark because a dog once bit her. Then stormed off, like entirely out of the restaurant area. I'm not sure where she was going. So we left. This was so uncalled for and upsetting! He's a ""real"" service dog, per the legal definition. They aren't robots! We'd driven hours in the car today and her terror of dogs probably didn't help much with his reaction to her. She could have handled this much, much better. She did not have to STRONGLY and RUDELY imply my service dog isn't actually a service dog! It's discriminatory and illegal.  It's like saying someone doesn't really need their wheelchair. Someone should train her on what she's legally allowed to do and not do when it comes to service animals. We left without eating. Still hungry. Ordering pickup. Too bad we didn't get to try the food.","Cincinnati, OH",0,37,2549

Captive audience, not much in the way of drop-in business, and trying to have something for anyone who passes through can lead to mediocre food.  I was pleasantly surprised here.  Oh, it was nowhere near great, but it was pretty good.Yesterday was rainy.  And it was National Comfort Food Day.  I figured they would have burgers, steak, meatloaf, basic comfort food.  Not really.  At least, not at lunch when I went.  What they have is a limited menu of sandwiches, wraps, soups, and salads.  Plus, a buffet with some of those items.  I opted for that- $9.95, and I got to try a few different things.The salad fixings were fresh and good.  Soup of the day was corn chowder, which I love, and which they did pretty darn well.  Thick, creamy, full of corn and other veggies and with a bit of pepper kick.The wraps seemed pretty plain so I tried two of the hot sandwiches, with some house-made potato chips.  The chips were stale.  They were probably okay when fresh.  And the sandwich buns were hard and dry- maybe due to sitting in the warmers, or maybe stale too.  A build-your-own sandwich bar might be a good idea, so that the buns stay fresh and the other ingredients are hot, instead of everything being lukewarm...  Anyway, I had a patty melt, which was pretty good besides the bun- beef, onions, cheese, you know what? Comfort food.  I also tried the chicken (fiesta chicken, I think.)  Meh.  Dry meat, not much flavor from the seasonings.The service was great, the place is nice, and the price is right.

We were gifted a CM gift card so we couldn't think of a better place to spend it than Hudson 29. Naturally, we ordered a bottle of wine. The wine list is very extensive for all those wine connoisseurs in the Columbus area. We went out of our comfort zone and order the full rack of ribs. We also ordered the burger and split the two. It was so good I was tempted to lick the plate clean. Service was very accommodating. We were sat right away at our reservation time, even with the place being completely full. It appeared to be a High School Valentine's Day dance with a lot of high school kids dressed for the nines. They were willing to split the meals in half to bring on two plates when we said we would be sharing. We told them that it wasn't necessary but we appreciated it. Great date night location!

She even ended up waving one of the appetizers and some of the mocktails one of the women in the group ordered. She was so so so pleasant.The food was great, too. I ordered the tuna tartare as am appetizer, which was so refreshing. As for my meal, I ordered the fried fish, which upik first glance looked like any fried fish you would get with a fish and chips type meal. However, the tartar sauce that came on the side and the non-greasy fish elevated it and gave it more depth of flavor.I would absolutely come back with a group as there was plenty of space for us, we did not feel rushed to get out once done, and overall there was plenty of availability where each person was able to order the drinks and food of their liking.","Columbus, OH",6,70,1058

The room was long and narrow, but it was heated and comfortable. We knew this restaurant was more pricey, so I was a little disappointed at first because it felt a little secluded from the actual restaurant, so we didn't get to experience the ambiance. Regardless, we were still happy to be there because we had heard great things. We both ordered wine and chips/chorizo queso to share, which was delicious!

It's very nice with several shops and restaurants. This restaurant is housed on the ground level of an apartment complex, and they have garage parking attached. We had a reservation on a Saturday night and had to wait 15-20 minutes past our reservation time before being seated. We were seated in the 'wine room' which is a little more intimate of an area with only 4 tables total. They also have a main dining area, bar area, and a private room that I'm assuming can accommodate larger parties. We picked Hudson 29 over some of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants this night in particular, because we wanted a wide menu with several different types of food. The menu offers a few appetizers, flatbreads, sushi, salads, sandwiches, steak, seafood entrees, pasta, and even BBQ ribs.For an appetizer, we got the King Kong sushi roll. It had crab mix, avocado, and cucumber with togarashi seasoning, topped with spicy scallops and spicy mayo -- talk about yum!! We didn't try them, but the cheese stuffed butter rolls looked delicious, so if we come back we'll definitely give those a try.We also split a Caesar salad which ended up being the perfect portion for each of us. For entrees, I tried the wood grilled salmon and my SO got the rigatoni bolognese. I really enjoyed the flavor of the salmon, but wasn't thrilled with the side. It came with couscous, raisins, almonds, cucumbers, radish, and what appeared to be sliced kale all mixed together. There was so many different textures that it just had a bit too much going on. It would have been better if the couscous and vegetables were served in their own portions.We tried the Texas sheet cake for dessert. I was hesitant at first because I'm not a huge chocolate fanatic and I feared it would be too rich, but it was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend whether you're a chocolate lover or not.Also shout out to our server Abby. She was great -- super friendly and jovial.","Columbus, OH",460,380,2048

The location has plenty of garage parking behind it, as well as a strip mall parking lot across the street. The inside of the restaurant was nice but some of the fixtures felt a bit dated. True to the form of a CM restaurant, the operation here is efficient - we were seated on time and our server, Jared, was polite and helpful. We settled on the Cheese Rolls, the Spicy Tuna sushi rolls for appetizers, followed by the Wood Grilled Salmon, the Gerber Farms Chicken, and a kid's menu Chicken Sandwich. For dessert, we got the Texas Sheet Cake and the Carrot Cake. We also ordered a cocktail from the menu - Daisy. All the dishes were large portions, including the chicken sandwich from the kids' menu. In terms of taste, the food was just ok - neither bad nor good. None of the appetizers or main course dishes particularly stood out as memorable and they were generally lacking any flavors. At this price point, I would expect more in terms of taste from a CM restaurant. The best item we tried was the Texas Sheet Cake - if I find myself back here, that is probably the only thing I would order. Overall, Hudson 29 came across as a tired establishment that is too comfortable in its ways - everything was just ok, and for me, I expect more from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.","Lewis Center, OH",65,137,1378

It's a toss up between chicken and falafel, but on my most recent visit, they had to make more falafel and I was a little time crunched, so I got the chicken, which pretty much fell apart it was so tender.

The cocktails were great and the meal didn't disappoint. We got the shrimp and chorizo pintxos, burrata, wedge salad and the paella.I loved the shrimp and chorizo, I felt it was very flavorful and was surprised by the size of the chorizo.The burrata was so so for me. I typically love burrata but the tomato was not enough to cut the richness of the avocado, burrata and oil. I wish it has pickled onions or Radish. Maybe even if they tomato was marinated and there was more of it it would be better.The wedge was very good I loved the spicy peppers. The paella was amazing. I don't love Lima beans so I just didn't eat them but overall would order again. I loved the texture of the rice and the large pieces of meat.

We were told they were clearing off a few tables and would seat us shortly. We went over to one of the long tables by the bar to wait and were completely ignored. No one asked us if we wanted drinks or water and we saw another couple who checked in after us get seated at a booth. We ran into another friend there who left because of the long wait. At 8pm we made the decision to leave and go to another restaurant.

Every Tuesday they have a 4 course rotating tasting menu. On the Tuesday I visited they offered course 1. Piquillos Rellenos, 2.

Lupo delivers in all respects -- food and service are spectacular and the ambience is pretty good as well. We hadn't been back since the pandemic :( and we were fortunate that it was a lovely evening so we could sit on their outdoor patio. They've changed up their menu a bit, but we were not disappointed with anything. We shared three tapas among the two of us. There was a fantastic eggplant dish on the specials menu which was stuffed with chorizo -- truly exceptional. We also got the foie gras and chicken liver pate which came with cherry compote and marcona almonds with a side of buttered crostini -- delicious. Their burrata was served on locally farmed tomato. It was so good, it literally transported me back to Naples, Italy , the last place we had comparable quality burrata. The coup de gras though was our main dish -- the Arroz Con Pollo 25, which is a divine  half-chicken, with cilantro garlic rice and chorizo. I am not a big fan of chicken when dining outside, but trust me this is exceptional. The only problem was that we were so stuffed from the tapas by the time the main dish arrived that we had to take most of it back home.

Their 4pm-6pm Happy Hour even extends to Saturday, and their ""Four Seasons Patio""ensures that there's enough space for you to get in on the fun. My wife and I split several starters. I enjoyed my chai old fashioned. Deviled Eggs were nice -- better than many others that I had in both size and flavor. Cornbread was really good as was the Pimento Cheese Dip. Fried Green Tomatoes were okay. Entree-wise, we split the Honey Butter Fried Chicken which laid across a bed of Brussel Sprouts  and Mashed Potatoes. I put this dish in the ""good-not-great"" category. We tried the Sweet Potato Pie dessert, and (unlike the Deviled Eggs) it disappointed in size and taste. But rooted in the ""Great"" category is the service. Our server Andre was magnificent in his knowledge of the menu and welcoming disposition.

The moment we stepped in, we were enveloped in an ambiance that can only be described as warmly inviting, with decorations that transported us to the charm of an old tavern. The unique decor contributed significantly to the overall atmosphere, making our evening even more special.The culinary experience at Subourbon was exceptional. Although I can't recall the specifics of what everyone ordered, the unanimous verdict was that each dish was a hit. A standout for me was their fried green tomato - an absolute revelation! It was so good that it left a lasting impression, becoming a highlight of our dining experience.The service we received was top tier. Our server was exceedingly attentive, ensuring that our evening progressed smoothly without any hitches. It's rare to find such dedicated service that makes you feel both valued and taken care of.However, it wasn't all without a slight drawback. My one and only gripe pertains to the bourbon pricing. While I understand that premium and allocated bottles come at a higher cost, I found the markups at Subourbon to be quite steep. This was true not only for the rare finds but also for what one might consider standard top-shelf bourbons. The prices seemed excessively high, which was a bit of a letdown in an otherwise impeccable dining experience.Despite this, our overall experience at Subourbon Restaurant was immensely enjoyable. From the atmospheric setting and the delectable food to the exemplary service, it was an evening to remember. While the bourbon prices were a tad disappointing, it doesn't detract from the fact that Subourbon offers a dining experience that's well worth indulging in. I would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a special dining experience, with a gentle reminder to be mindful of the bourbon selections if you're watching your budget.","Columbus, OH",22,103,1980

My first visit was on a Thursday during happy hour. The happy hour menu, portions and pricing are exceptional! You've got a good selection of southern comfort classics to choose from. They're prepared and presented very well. Service was as good as the food, from the hostess to the server, it was very friendly and attentive. I enjoyed my experience so much that I had to bring my husband. I'm unaware of any happy hours on the weekend, so a Saturday H. H. was perfect. Saturday happy hours are the same as the weekdays - 4pm - 6pm. Same great menu and service. This visit I had the pleasure of meeting, I believe a general manager. Regardless of his title, he was very passionate about this restaurant and how our experience was. He made it a priority to talk with us and answer all questions we had. He made us feel very welcomed! He also told us about the sister restaurant - Alqueria. I've totally been mispronouncing that word! I'll definitely be visiting soon if it's anything like Subourban. So, two visits in 2 days, practically tried the entire happy hour menu and still can't wait to come back! I think I've found my new favorite happy hour spot!For good ambience (enclosed and outdoor patio), great service and absolutely delicious food, Subourban deserves a visit. I recommend the pork belly, catfish & okra, Bbq shrimp, gumbo, chopped salad, fried green tomatoes and derby pie. That almost covers the happy hour menu - just go, you will not be disappointed!

This restaurant has been a few iterations in my life. Met two good Yelp friends for happy hour, and we sat in the front by the bar area. I really like the open windows, let's great light in. They have a small front patio area, but it butts right up to W. Dublin-Granville Rd, so I wonder if the traffic noise is a nightmare during rush hour and summer months?Subourbon has decent number of happy hour offerings in the food department. Our waitress was succinct and friendly. For some reason, I got an odd vibe when I asked what she recommended on the menu, but that's a personal thing, so take it with a grain of salt.  I tried their Pork Belly starter and Cast Iron Cornbread starter. The chunks of pork belly were fantastic. Perfectly done, great meat-to-fat ratio. I'm not a big bbq fan, and since these were lightly glazed/drizzled, the meat flavor shown through, delish! The corn puree and broccoli matched well with the protein. The corn bread was a hard no. It was basically a conglomeration of sugar. I could not taste corn; and, while I love a natural, gritty corn texture, this was not appeasing to my tongue, nor tastebuds. I'm glad I finally made it to this small restaurant - I've passed this brick and mortar a gazillion times over the last 25 years. I'd come back and try other items if invited, but I have too many must-try's that retuning is not high on my list.","Columbus, OH",137,179,1543

Nothing. Not even close.Cubano Sandwich - ok, not great, not enough mustard. The pork is - I'd bet money on this - probably from the white plastic tub of shredded pork from Gordon Food Service. I'm serious. The flavor was lacking and the shred was way too fine for house cooked.I grew up 45 minutes from LittleHavana in Miami, and have eaten a LOT of Cuban sandwiches. This disappointed.Croquetas - decent. Fine. OK. Probably bought premade and frozen at Sam's Club or Costco. At least they were fried very well with a nice hard crispy out shell. But they were served with a side of mediocre bottled Ranch Dressing for dipping sauce. WTF? Are you kidding me...? Ranch dressing for croquetas? That's a party foul if I've ever seen one. In Havana they'd run you off the island for that.Sopa de pollo - it was ok. Served WAY TOO HOT - so hot it scalded the roof of my mouth even after letting it sit with the lid off for 10 minutes.Black beans & white rice - the rice was dry, like it had been sitting in a warming pan for too long. That's just lazy to not make a fresh batch for 50 cents. The beans needed significantly more seasoning for flavor, and were also kinda dry.And a can of Diet Coke. It was awesome...So they were 1 for 5. We would not order ANY of the food again.There are great options at North Market Dublin, and this meal at Pablo's was mediocre and lame for Cuban food.My mother always said you can say something nice about anything, so here goes, Mom.... the bread on the Cubano was excellent.

There are only a handful of spots right out front of Si Señor (maybe 4), and during the busy lunch hour it is hard to find an open spot.

We were able to get a table inside. It's small inside but they have a decent amount of seating. I was able to find parking in the parking lot.  My friend and I shared some sandwiches.  They all sounded so good that we had a hard time choose which one.  Every sandwich we tried was delicious with toasted bread and great sauces.  The sauces really make the sandwich taste pop and the ingredients on each sandwich work together very well. Great price for sandwiches ~$10.  Very filling!

The ratio of lobster to bread was pretty even. Lobster was not dry but moist and buttery. The clam chowder was good but some of the clams weren't cleaned all the way, there was still sand in them.

For $15 the portion was mediocre, I get inflation but potatoes themselves are still pretty cheap so I'm surprised that even just fry wise, it was pretty barren. Anyway, food itself was alright, a bit salty but lobster was poached well and fries mostly held up. I did somehow end up with mostly claw meat which isn't my favorite part of the lobster but probably just random. The worst part was biting down and finding rather large pieces of shell in my food.

I ordered the crab Rangoon pizza and garlic knots. The crab Rangoon pizza was pretty good but the edges were a bit burnt. It has a sweeter taste due to the Thai chilli sauce. It reminded me of sushi pizza but instead of the typical fried rice paper base it's a regular pizza crust. What I was most disappointed about were the garlic knots. They were burnt and stuck to the tin box that they were prepared in. I could only eat bits and pieces of the actual garlic knots.

The pizza is great, and I recently tried both the Phat Ranch and This Little Piggy (Q1 Special). The latter was delicious with its juicy pulled pork. Ordering online is a breeze, but the only downside is that you can't add special requests. I only bring this up, because I like my pizza extra crispy, but when ordering online you aren't able to request this. The coffee is also delicious. I've tried a few of their whole bean varieties to brew at home, and my favorite thus far has been the Bright Eyed. I think it's also worth noting that you can order 6 packs online, and pick them up to-go which is very convenient. Prices for the 6 packs are super reasonable as well, some as low as $8.

But from my limited experience, I think this place is awesome.Attached to the main joint, there's a neat little coffee shop thats open in the mornings. I got an iced coffee and it was pretty good. They also have their own roasted beans that you can buy. I was surprised, but also excited to see, that they serve breakfast sandwiches. Side note for those with pups -- the coffee shop is VERY dog friendly. If you stop by, you'll see what I mean. On to the main joint. They have a multitude of specialty pizzas which all sound amazing. After much mental deliberation, I settled on the 'Chick n Waffle' pizza and holy moly was this delicious. I'm not kidding when I say immediately after the first bite my taste buds were in euphoria. The pecorino romano cheese sprinkled throughout combined with the maple glaze absolutely made the pizza. What I also found to be awesome was that they sliced the medium pizza into 12 slices, with each being 2-3 inches in circumference of crust, which made each slice easily able to be eaten without having to fold or contort it into my mouth. It also made me feel like I was getting more pizza, which is all the better.","University District, Columbus, OH",3,58,1296

"Saucy Brew Works","https://www.yelp.com/biz/saucy-brew-works-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Elizabeth Y.",3,"2023-07-25","Saucy Brew Works is a mixture of things.  Its a brewery, pizza cafe and coffee shop.   Somehow that all works.  Ive had coffee here in the past, its pretty good and they come up with fun specialty drinks.   We went for pizza this time:   So the inside of the pizza shop has a long bar with bar stools to drink/eat at.  You place your order for food here as well. The dining room consists mostly of long tables that have seats that are technically individual swings.  Fun concept. There is also outdoor seating covered by an awning. I dont like beer but i liked this beer.  I got something that had mango in it (maybe ""oh my god, Becky"") and then ordered a mushroom pizza.  My husband got ruckin' fadiculous pizza which was better than the mushroom one.  They are thin, hand tossed pizzas, but not super thin. Pizzas as a whole, could of had more flavor tbo but were still very good.   We also tried the garlic pretzel sticks.  So good highly recommend the pretzel sticks.   Fav: pretzels and the beer.  We ordered three small pizzas, pretzel sticks. A dessert and two beers.  Beers were given to us at time of ordering.  Then pretzels arrived.   Ten min later a pizza and dessert arrived-- five minutes later  two more pizzas arrived.    It was a bit odd timing as it wasn't crazy busy.  Enjoyed our trip there.  Would go back,  but not routinely.   Three stars do to timing of pizzas and flavor.","Columbus, OH",517,147,1396

It was my first time visiting this part of town. There is no reserved parking for Saucy Brew Works, so you will need to find a spot on the street.The restaurant / bar was not busy when we arrived. We grabbed a table in the corner. We started off with ordering beers. They had some interesting options. I got the What's His Nuts, which is a peanut butter stout. It was heavy but had good flavor.We then ordered our food. They had brunch options but I went with a pulled pork sandwich off their main menu. For my side I went with the broccoli slaw. I also got an order of the Saucy Bread to share.The food arrived after 10 or 15 minutes. The Saucy Bread was delicious, with a strong garlic flavor. The pulled pork sandwich was also great. The broccoli slaw wasn't too my liking but I don't think it was bad. I would probably have preferred the side salad.Overall I enjoyed my visit and would like to visit again.","Columbus, OH",7,129,965

To order food and drinks we used a QR code so no one actually greeted us. Most of us simply ordered a beer to start, and after 40 minutes nothing had come. My friend and I ended up getting in line to order straight from the bar. They were busy so took another 15 minutes just to get to the top of the line. One I was up there and ordered the same drinks as before I saw them pick up the drinks from my previous order that was just sitting there and gave it to me. I even asked if they could just make me the second drink since I was up there already and they said they would bring it too me. 20 minutes passed by and no luck so had to go back up to the bar to ask for my drink.

This was my first time eating grown up ramen so it's possible I don't love ramen like some people but overall I'd say it was okay. I got the chicken ramen (no spice) which comes with chicken broth and fried chicken. For me the highlight was the fried chicken and egg, both were cooked well (the chicken may have been slightly dry but it wasn't noticeable when soaked in broth) with a good crust on the chicken without being greasy. The noodles (and granted it was carry out) were clumped together despite eating within 15 minutes of pick up. And required some work to not be clumpy. The broth was ok but nothing great in my opinion- a little salty and chicken taste but little other flavors.

We all love to drink, have some great food and talk loudly, this was the perfect spot for all of the above. We of course, started out with drinks. I got a CBC IPA and my got a couple of Stella Artois.  For my meal I got the Mussels, which was prepared with white wine, spicy cream sauce, sourdough croutons, and topped with parmesan cheese. The mussels were delicious and cooked perfectly, every one of them was open. The croutons were large enough to be considered slices of bread, amazing and so flavorful. My man got the fish tacos for his meal. They were made from fried cod, spicy cream sauce, Pico de Gallo, avocado, and served on a soft tortilla. My man is not a fan of avocado, so he removed his. Over the last few years, I have become more tolerable of avocado, so I left it on my taco. YUMMY!Service was quick considering our friends beat us to the restaurant and already had a table.

O'Reilly's is a cool boozy hangout that caters to an older locals crowd.  It's a certified dive wirh an Irish theme that's got that Thurman's, India Oak Grill, Mama's Pasta and Brew kind of vibe.2.  Bartenders? Jill is the fun one.  She'll say almost anything with a salty sassiness that really lights the place up.  I've also met another bartender who's also super nice but she has a little more down to earth, down to business way of doing things.3.   They've got a pretty impressive menu with wallet friendly prices.  There's all kinds of burgers, subs, sandwiches with a big selection of the usual deep fried bar food you'd expect.  4.  Their daily specials are pretty sweet too and they are a big hit with all the locals that come in.  Look for it by the kitchen door.5.  The jukebox.  Im guessing it was last updated around 1998 or so.  That's not a bad thing as it's a cool eclectic mix of retro music that just fits the place.  ***Please note my personal thank you to the staff and management for not having it cranked up to 11.Go there if you like good hearty food in an authentic dive...AndIHaveToGiveYouMyThoughtsOnSomeOfTheFoodI'veTried...Rachel: Aka Turkey Reuben.  It's a freaking awesome sandwich with just the right amount of savory goodness.  Get the fries with it.Fish and Chips: It's a solid meal.  It's a big portion that tastes great and it will fill you up for a reasonable amount of USDs.Veggie Sub: As good as anyone elses.  I'm happy their's come with chips and a pickle spear at no extra charge.Wings: They come breaded and sauced.  No joke, these are seriously the biggest wings I've ever seen!  Celery and ranch/bleu cheese are an upcharge.Chili: Mark K got this and had nothing but good things to say about it.

It's a fairly nondescript building on High, decent parking out front. It's pretty small inside, and the floors are weird. Step up to get in, and then the ceiling feels kind of low, and the bar is actually lower than the rest of the room. That might be more efficient for them? Feels a little awkward but not awful. Pretty big menu, lots of interesting bar type food. I was here for what everyone recommended, the pepper burger and the sweet potato fries. Both of which were excellent. Among the best in town, and the best I've ever had, of each. The burger was thick and juicy and meaty. I like pepper, but I was afraid it would be over the top. It was not. A perfect complement to the meat. A little bit of a zing on your tongue afterwards, but not overdone. Fresh toppings, piled high, good bun. All melding into a beautiful whole. The sweet potato fries are perfectly cooked, and came with a zesty ranch-southwestern type dipping sauce. Coke as my drink. All that for $12. 12! For a good, big burger, and a ton of good sweet potato fries, and a pop. I think it was a lunch deal, or they just liked me.Good service, although they seemed a little short staffed so it was pretty curt. But when they did have a chance to stop and talk they were super friendly and laid-back. Seem to be a lot of regulars here. It's definitely worth coming back.

Free shirt for first 50 customers, and it's a nice one.Super friendly, laid back, lots of family helping out looked like.  Small space, bright and cheery inside.  Fair amount of tables.  Plenty of street parking early on a weekend, but at busy times during the school year might be tight.  And free parking on Sundays; I didn't see a sign that said it, but I know that's true elsewhere in town, and the parking app wouldn't let me pay.  Interesting menu, and I just went with my standard lox.  Sweetie got the steak, egg, and cheese.  Lots of other things that look good.  We also got a maple one with cinnamon sprinkled on plain cream cheese.  Sweetie liked hers.  I liked mine.  Good bagel (I went with everything,) fresh tomato, onion, lots of tender tasty salmon, I think garlic herb cheese spread, etc.  Yum.  Decent prices.  Handy location.  I bet we end up here a lot on Sunday mornings.","Columbus, OH",321,3862,1389

My girlfriend and I ordered The Big Daddy and The Frenchie respectively - and both had such unique tastes that we had never had in a breakfast sammy before. The hashbrown was such a subtle addition that made a huge difference texture-wise, and both the cream cheese and the maple syrup on our respective sandwiches made each bite a unique infusion of flavors that was really delicious. We went here because I had a $50 gift card thanks to an Instagram raffle - but I can promise we'll be returning many times more. Also - the interior was really cute and modern!

One cuisine I have been really interested in trying is Indian as it wasn't something I had at all growing up and am just largely unfamiliar with it. I've been eyeing this spot for quite a while now and when I had to make a stop at the FedEx right next door I decided to give it a go. We arrived around 5:45 on a Friday and were seated with no wait. I had the mango lassi to drink and it was really delicious. It had that nice thick consistency (like a drinkable yogurt) and a great mango flavor. We didn't get any appetizers but I would like to try some of them in the future. For my entree I tried the chicken korma just based on the description on the menu. I ordered it mild and I think next time I would add a bit more spice. The flavors of this dish were absolutely incredible and had a bit of sweetness that I really liked. The pieces of chicken were really juicy, but I do wish there had been more. My friend ordered the chicken saagwala and that had even less pieces of meat in it, so I think there's some consistency issue there. I tried his sauce with some of the garlic naan we ordered and I really liked it as well, but not as much as the korma. For dessert I tried another new item for me, rasmalai. The flavor and texture were unlike anything I'd ever had before and I was a huge fan. Overall the food here was amazing and I am really glad I tried it. I'd love to return and try some of the other items on the menu. The only less than ideal part of our visit was the service. After the food was delivered we never heard from our server again even though we saw her walking around the small dining room. We had to ask the person taking our plates away to get our server for us so we could order dessert. But other than that very minor issue this was a great visit.","Wheeling, IL",38,11,1894

I don't like to be negative, so I'm just going to lay out what happened and you can do what you want with it. They greeted us right away and took us to the bar area to be seated. We were a large party of 8 so I appreciated the great service.The restaurant was less than a quarter full. I asked if we could have the table next to the one they presented because it had more comfortable seats. All the sudden a lady popped out the back and then said they were going to love us. Ok, they moved us by the cold front door but ok, whatever. The table next to us was complaining to the manager for a bit so not sure why you would put us right by them when there were dozens of empty tables elsewhere...They then got our drinks and took our order quickly. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. First person's food came approximately 30 minutes later. I was one of the first to get my food and my sweet potato fries were cold, but my happy hour hamburger was on point, would highly recommend that!The last persons food came a good 7 minutes after the first persons and it included an appetizer that they got the same late time as their meal! Zero apologies or acknowledgment about the delay for this. I understand it's a larger party but at this point there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Not sure why the big delay.

I didn't have any issues and the food and coffee, it was always pretty good but this weekend it was unacceptable. The food showed up at a proper time with no errors, but the delivery person told me she dropped the drinks on the way over so they're going to remake them. I said absolutely no worries, it happens and to take her time. By ""take your time"" i didn't mean take over an hour for 2 smoothies and 2 coffees. When I call back, they say they totally forgot and they'll get to it. Immediately someone knocks on my door and delivers the smoothies and coffees, so I call back again to tell them not to remake anything because someone it was already on the way without them knowing? Then, my friend who ordered the coffee held it up- completely curdled, absolutely disgusting. She tries it and says it was totally sour, and I smell it and refuse to even taste it. It smells horrible, which I don't even know how because she had ordered oat milk and it was clearly spoiled regular milk. I called them to let them know and ask if they wouldn't mind remaking it one more time, and they said yes absolutely and were very friendly.And then.... we never heard from them again and never got the new coffee. And I still do not see any refund on my card (but this could supposedly take some time). It's really too bad for this bad experience because, as I said before, the food and drinks here are good. I can't see myself ordering from here anymore when the biggest plus is the convenience and it is totally inconvenient to have to call so many times and get ignored.","Columbus, OH",0,6,1723

I am personally against getting something like that in a restaurant but to each their own I suppose.I have tried several of their sushi's, but Tempura shrimp has been my favorite.

We wanted the fried cauliflower but they've been out for months apparently. The pickles came out hot and weren't overly pickley and well battered and crisp. I actually enjoyed it with the ranch. I got the mother mohawk and french onion soup as my main and again, I found both to be very enjoyable. I wish the bread in the soup wasn't soaked through so I could have some textural contrast but the melty cheese on top helped.

My friend and I went with salads, me the california salad and him the chef salad- and they were so great, and full of ingredients- my fav. My nephew got Mac and cheese- his complaint was it was too cheesy (this is not a complaint about the Old Mohawk, more just that he is young and wanted Kraft Mac and cheese style) so my friend took it home and said it heated up excellently and was even better the next day.

Six month old  Lupita's in Marion Village on the corner of East Morrill and S High is a definite ""must go to"" restaurant.  Lupita's serves traditional mexican food but it is not your ordinary Mexican restaurant.  Dont expect to see a sombrero, maracas,  or loudly painted booths with loud mariachi music playing.  Nope. That is not hereInstead you are going to find a very well stocked tequilia bar and a dining room that has white table cloths. Black and white photos of various Mexican cities hang tastefully on the wall.  And OMG the food is great.  The space breathes authenticity.  Pretty much anything you are looking for will be on the menu.   If you are a vegetarian you are in luck! They actually have a large vegetarian selection of entrees which made me happy as I often gravitate towards vegetarian dishes.  Living in a world where everything is ""extra"", I really appreciated how at Lupita's not only are you served complimentary chips and salsa you actually get a ""trio"" of salsa and an order of bean dip.   And wow, you can tell each item is freshly made in house! Soon our entrees came: the chicken/chorizo fajita and a choripollo entree.  The choripollo was a large tender chicken breast seasoned, served in a cheese sauce with a chorizo patty on top.   My very picky chorizo eater ate every last bit of it, not realizing he was saying ""mmmmmm"" as he ate it.     My fajita chicken was nicely seasoned and tender.  Everything was delicious.  Add a margarita and the bill was about 40 bucks Wait!  I forgot to add:  Omg...The bar!  The bar has almost every variety of tequila that Ive ever heard of and some ones I haven't heard of.  So if you like tequila... this is the place to go! I highly recommend this restaurant to all reading.   Tip: if you have any mobility problems you might want to skip the taller booths and opt for one of the lower tables or booths.  The taller ones are super comfortable, but they are a little hard to get in and out of.","New Albany, OH",66,203,2022

It was giving a bit of pre mix flavor, but I'm pretty sure I overheard the bartender saying he would like to change up the recipe in the future. They have only been open just over a month so I think there are some changes still being made. All the chips and dips were great. They definitely go above and beyond with the free salsa and bean dip. The cheese dip was really good IMO. The speedy gonzalas happy hour special came out super hot! So had to let it cool down a bit, and unfortunately the hard taco got soggy in that time so couldn't really eat it, just picked at the filling. Food was good. Finally, the check came out with QR code to scan to pay! I though that was cool and unexpected. Scanning to pay way super easy.

We wanted a snack as we did not want to eat a full meal, so we ordered up the pretzels and beer cheese. These were delicious, soft and flavorful. The beer cheese had a great consistency, and the flavor was great. I also enjoy the pretzels with some of the stone ground mustard they have at the able as well.

There is a lot out back with validation for two hours, or additional free street parking.The inside is spacious with a variety of tables and seating options. They also have a sectional couch in one corner, because why not?I got a drip coffee, which cost around $3 for about an 8 ounce cup. They offer $1 refills if you plan to stay awhile. They have a handful of bakery items in the morning, including a homemade pop-tart which I'm not sure is made in house or not, but either way looked pretty good.Overall, Bada Bean Bada Booze is a phenomenal place to visit if you're looking for a brew -- coffee or beer.","Columbus, OH",460,380,967

So far, I've only been to grab a coffee or to get some work done with the help of a pick-me-up latte. The space itself is located right behind Hoof Hearted, it's not hard to find parking outside, and they have a patio. It's modern, has an open ceiling giving it industrial vibes, yet kinda feels like an old diner... but elevated. Not sure if any of that makes sense so peep at the photos I shared. There's giant doors that look like windows that are sometimes open to an attached space. It's clearly an office or coworking space or something, but I haven't been able to figure that part out yet. The Bada Bee signature drink has been my favorite (anything lavender and I'm on it). They also have Kittie Cakes pastries. Those pop tarts are no joke!

Caspian - Persian food, has been around for a while, but as a catering business; this is their first foray into brick and mortar.Anna H. and I met here for lunch back in June. This restaurant use to house Layla's Kitchen (Indian), so there's been some cosmetic revamping, like the front outdoor patio. Tables are spaced for pandemic regulations, and there's room to move about. The inside space is small, and with tables being 6 ft apart, there's less seating, fyi. I tried that day's Falafal Wrap lunch special, which was very good. While it wasn't my all-time number 1, it was a solid contender. The chickpea-based rounds (no, I'm not saying balls, so just get over it) were hot; served on the soft, tasty pita round was a delight. The house sauce was a nice complement. I would like to try Caspian's Mirza Ghasemi appetizer (sounds delish!) and a few of their kebab entrees.

I also asked for the kabobs to be ""spicy"" - but no worries because they were not ""spicy hot"", they were certainly an explosion of perfect beef flavor! My friend ate the lamb chops and he commented they were absolutely delicious! This was the first time I have ever eaten Mirza Ghasemi: a dish of mashed up grilled eggplant, eggs, garlic and grilled onion. It is traditionally eaten with bread. At first it tasted like baba ghanouj- a traditional Levant dish made of grilled eggplant - but taking a second bite made my senses realize that this masterpiece is eggplant on FLAME! It was beautifully smoky and wonderfully spiced. It is an elevated baba ghanouj that I wish my arab forefathers would have adopted in their own culture. Mad props to the Persians for this exquisite flavored recipe! I should note the dish does not look appetizing, but looks are certainly deceiving with this dish.

I ordered the Soppressate which was wonderful the flatbread being nice and crispy with the honey and loads of cheese. It said hot honey but didn't seem hot to me. Hubby ordered the Shrimp Pasta and he said it was Wonderful. Another 10 stars for presentation. Oh I forgot we ordered the Meatball Appetizer.. It was Wonderful..

The size of the entrees though.....we were laughing when they came out. The ""bang bang salmon"" had two little nuggets of salmon that looked like they were cut off the ends of an actual salmon filet.  Short rib entree also had a very skimpy serving of meat. The food didn't even fill up the plates. I am not sure if that was just because of restaurant week pricing or that is the regular entree portion size they serve.

"Xi Xia Chinese Cuisine","https://www.yelp.com/biz/xi-xia-chinese-cuisine-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Binnan O.",5,"2024-01-09","I grew up eating authentic Chinese food in San Diego and LA and have been to China multiple times so believe me when I say Xixia's noodles holds its own among the best hand pulled noodle places I've had. The attention to texture and flavors is just absolutely amazing. If this is your first time, there is an ordering kiosk by the entrance for take-out only but you can absolutely dine-in and scan the QR code on the napkin box to pull up the menu and order. Food comes at various times but noodles are generally very fast with fried foods coming out slower. My wife LOVES their Xixia stirred noodles which is a simple dish of noodles with soy and garlic but it's mind-blowingly complex when you actually taste it. We spoke with the chef and they had to source their preferred soy sauce from China because they couldn't find a supplier locally. They then add their own secret seasonings to the soy and top it with a splash of their house-made chili oil and a healthy amount of fresh garlic. The dish tastes light and clean with savoriness and saltiness being extremely well-balanced. My warning for this dish is that it only comes with four slices of beef, it's enough to add beefy flavor to maybe every other bite but the star of the dish is the noodles and not the protein. I could see Americans, who are generally very meat-centric, being disappointed if they didn't know this. My personal favorite is the spicy beef noodle which comes in a rich and complex bone broth they start preparing the night before. The chilis they add lend some smokiness and a solid (but not excessive) amount of heat. The morsels of shredded beef are tender and well portioned to the amount of noodles. I'd recommend the thick cut noodles for this fish as they're chewier than the thin ones and add a nice textural element. We've had the Dan Dan noodles which are peanut-y and have that wonderful Sichuan peppercorn numbing effect that'll leave your tongue slightly buzzing. It could use a touch more spiciness in my opinion but I'm admittedly a nut for spicy things. The salt and pepper fried chicken is pretty mild with a simple ground rice breading but the brined chicken thigh chunks come out SOO TENDER it's still worth getting. They serve it with their sweet & sour sauce which thankfully is not cloyingly sweet like other places. The egg rolls are the thicker wonton wrapper style egg rolls (as opposed to the thinner paper-like ones). They do use quality ingredients in their egg rolls and they're fried fresh and not just reheated.Overall I'd say Columbus is blessed to have such an authentic Chinese noodle restaurant. Xixia clearly cares about its ingredients, processes, and takes a very gourmet approach to each and every one of its dishes. It is a completely different experience from the typical Chinese-American take out experience the Midwest is used to. If you've never had authentic hand pulled noodles you absolutely must give this place a try!","Indianapolis, IN",105,461,2945

We had the spicy fish filets, the stir fried veggies, the bok Choy, and the wide noodle dapanji. Among these I think the dapanji was the most interesting, as the noodles were tasty and just right. The rest of the meal was flavorful; not necessarily top end for the dishes we got, but good. For instance the fish fillets were fried and then put in the spicy soup, which isn't 100% authentic (and a relatively soggy experience), but it is tasty. Note that we got takeout, so some of these dishes might be better in person at the restaurant. All things considered though, the range of dishes offered by this restaurant look very interesting and authentic (I just returned from living in China for several years) so I am excited to try more of the menu.

Serving their food made-to-order in The Hills Downtown, one of the owners (nice gal, indeed) verbally took my order and quoted a 20 minute wait for pick up (at the counter inside The Hills). I was bummed that several of my top choices on their menu were currently out, so I settled for the Mirza Ghasemi (grilled eggplant, egg, tomato and garlic) and a chicken kabob. The Mirza Ghasemi was delicious! I ate some with the accompanying bread, and ended up just eating it with a spoon so I wouldn't get full on the carbs. I highly recommend this starter. As for my chicken kabob, I was quite disappointed. The chicken was not very juicy, grilled a smidge too long. The roasted bell peppers were good, but there were only three or four small pieces, so not enough to give the meat an extra bump of flavor. The accompanied yellow saffron rice was also bland. For the price, one recommendation would be to pay a bit more attention to consistent cooking times and flavor profiles. I'm sure I'll eventually get to this Hills in due time, and if Charmy's Mirza Ghasemi is available, I'd gladly get that dish. It's perfect with a home-cooked protein, on a salad,  the list goes on.","Columbus, OH",897,1884,1282

It's not a full restaurant at all--almost a ghost kitchen, so it's a bit confusing when you walk in. You go back to the fresh food area and order at the pizza/deli counter.  You can also call ahead to order. Once it's ready you can pay and enjoy inside the market which has plenty of seating. The ladies behind the counter were incredibly kind and helped us decide on what to order. We ordered the salmon kabob, the eggplant lentil stew and an eggplant dip (Khoresh Bademjan). The salmon was tender and perfectly cooked on a bed of saffron rice with a whole roasted tomato. Nothing fancy, but perfectly executed. With a very substantial serving of salmon (probably close to 8 oz). It had the perfect slight char of a fire grill and the saffron rice was so aromatic and fresh. The stew was incredible--flavorful, rich, and vegetarian for my mom. She was a bit skeptical walking in about the concept of a restaurant operating within a market but by the first few bites was calling the place a hidden gem. It's clear that this stew was slow cooked with so much attention. I have never really enjoyed soups with lentils in the description, but this was otherworldly. The appetizer was by far the star. A warm eggplant dip with dried buttermilk powder, mint, aromatics and walnuts was something new to me. Think baba ganoush but better than any baba ganoush you've ever had. The crunch of the walnuts, the creaminess of the eggplant. It's been a full day and I'm still thinking about it. Charmys is one of the best meals that I've ever eaten in Columbus --no exaggeration. It's a must visit and I'm so excited for the folks that come upon it.","Columbus, OH",39,85,1728

That is such a great convenience for this Clintonville location.Last night I picked up dinner for my boyfriend and myself, and we each ordered the chicken sandwich (his the hottest you can get, while mine was the warm version), and we each also ordered a couple sides of ranch, a side of baked beans, mac and cheese, and banana pudding for dessert.I love the crisp on the chicken; it gets perfectly crunchy on the outside while staying moist inside. By ordering the sandwich, it comes with coleslaw on it which is nice so I don't have to order coleslaw as a separate side. Then, when it comes to the bakes beans and mac and cheese sides, I end up mixing the two together. Since the baked beans have a liiiiittle spice to them, it helps add a little spice to the mac and cheese and makes everything super creamy with the sauce from the baked beans.","Columbus, OH",54,29,934

We've been going to HCT (not this location) for what, 10 years?  Right from the start.  Back then, and for many years, an order would stuff me and give me enough leftovers for another meal.  More locations opened, portion sizes started dropping, prices went up.  Understandable to some extent.  The last year or so I've been biting the bullet and getting myself two entrees and sometimes two sides, finishing most in a sitting and having at least some left over.  Lately this has been our main location because of convenience- drive-through, centrally-located.  Been coming here since it opened, too.  But we come less and less often.  Service is always good.  The food is still good.  A la carte now, which is probably a good idea, to avoid wastage.  But more and more expensive for less and less food.  No more free tea.  No more being stuffed.  And jeez, today I scaled back my order and it was still $50 for two adults and a kid- two adult entrees, one kid's meal, two sides, a tea and a pudding.And, especially at this location, every single time something is wrong with the order.  Partly on me, I should check, but I trust them, and if the right number of items seems to be in the bag I skate (kids get impatient, and this already takes awhile.)  Always a mistake somewhere that I find at home.Are the price and accuracy issues due to new owners?  Just due to endless expansion?  I don't know.  But I'm sad.  We'll still come, a couple times a year.  But we just can't justify it any more.","Columbus, OH",229,12,1520

We diced to try out Hoyos kitchen after a long time.  Have to say first, don't think the prices are comparable and a little outrageous.  Previously used to be $13 for the mango chicken, now it's $18 WOW.  That is a big difference and honestly if one is to charge that amount for a bowl, it should be packed with lots of flavor and /or quantity. Ordered the Somalian rice as the base, mango chicken, lentils, cooked cabbage. Topped with tomato, cucumber and spinach. Again, I think for the price they could add more, especially on the fresh items to at least make you feel like you got your money's worth.  Also ordered a samosa.  Originally ordered the chicken but that was not ready so he gave us the beef.Now for the flavor.  The bowl was bland and I was super sad about that. I love ethnic flavors to build upon each other. However this was lacking and just felt like simple food. The samosas However was filled with flavor and was cooked perfectly, just wish the main meal had that much flavor provided. Overall, I would try them again but will most likely sample the protein first to ensure flavor is coming through and would also advise to add more since charging such high amount for a simple rice and meat bowl.","Blacklick, OH",9,70,1303

I was in Columbus for a conference, staying at the Hilton, and the food market was only a 6 min walk away from the hotel. The food at Hoyos is served Chipotle-style in that you get to choose your protein and toppings and build your own meal. The staff was just as friendly as mentioned in other reviews, and there was plenty of seating on the second level. I had the bowl with half and half Somali rice and spicy rice, half goat and half mango chicken, all of which were delicious and flavorful, but the chicken was my favorite: slightly sweet with a kick of spicy heat that enhanced rather than overpowered the other flavors. The spicy rice was also nicely spicy but not in the way that leaves your mouth hurting. I slightly preferred the yellow Somali rice. For sides, I got half spinach, cabbage, and lentils which were all so flavorful and refreshingly, not overcooked. The ginger-pineapple lemonade was absolutely delicious and went with the meal perfectly.","Denver, CO",2,49,1132

The rice was flavorful. The beef suqaar was kind of tough, dry, and flavorless. I was hoping for meat that was tender and requires less chewing. Chickpeas were delicious but spinach was okay.

I was curious about the spicy rice and wanted to sample it but they would not provide a sample and suggested I get half and half. Which I did.

My only critique (and it is a very small one) is that I wished somewhere on the physical menu or online, they provided descriptions of their items.

It's a counter service place but the food is much better than you think it will be. The restaurant is operated by the same folks that created Northstar. It has great vegetarian selections and has an overall healthy menu. They also have their own garden plus they recycle everything with absolutely no waste. I like everything I've tried here. The complaint is that it's pretty expensive. That's expected with the Wexner Center location. It's not cheap but it's still mostly worth it. The vegan breakfast burrito is $9. It comes with broccoli, potatoes, roasted red peppers, soy sausage, and tofu. The hummus and vegetable plate is about $7. I like the quinoa salad. This can be ordered without the chicken. The nachos are good but they're more than $9. It seems more than a bit much for the portion. The Thai peanut Luna burger is about $10. It comes with arugula, cilantro slaw, and sweet chili sauce. They have an extensive menu of coffees, espressos, and lattes each about $3. They have craft beer for $2.50 and wine for $5. It's also 10% off for students and Wexner Center members. This is nice to visit after the museum.  I think this is one of the best restaurants on campus. It's great to see a restaurant take care of the environment.

There is a lot of variety in the menu, and even more common dishes have special twists, like the arugula and pickled red onion topping on the Chipotle Buffalo Chicken.The food options are also very accommodating for vegetarians and gluten free choices - just ask at the counter for the list of gf options, if desired - which even includes several desserts from the case!On our most recent visit, my husband enjoyed the Chipotle Buffalo Chicken with kettle chips, and I had the Eye Opener Burrito sans tortilla to make it gluten free.  We both loved our dishes.  I loved the use of chorizo sausage in the burrito, and it was served with some great hot sauce and salsa to add as desired.  The sandwiches come with a number of options for the side, including salad, kettle chips, fruit, and something called ""The Grainy,"" which is described as grains with veggies that change periodically.While it is a touch pricey, I wouldn't consider it cost prohibitive, particularly given the focus on local ingredients and the location inside a museum.

The atmosphere was nice, we were lucky to have a corner booth and staged away from the center of restaurant that was quite crowded.  Aside from food, this would be a 4-5 star review.  Considering the price, the food is no more than 4 stars.  Oysters were great, Tuna Tartare was nothing special, Tuna Steak was blah, my wife's Filet was pretty darn good.  I'd guess that other steaks would have been good options too.  The Brussel Sprouts side was weird... they were shredded and had onion and other fillers.  Overall, if I could rate 3.5 I would choose that over my given 3-star review.  For less $$$ and a better experience, you could visit one of dozens of well-known locally owned Columbus restaurants.It was okay... we'll continue to visit the aforementioned local Columbus brands for Steak, Seafood or otherwise...

The waitress was attentive in the beginning, but once the restaurant got busier our drinks were empty for a little bit. Ordered off the restaurant week menu! Started with the side salad with ranch. It was your typical side salad, but very good. The ranch tasted fresh and homemade. The bread came out fresh and paired nicely with the butter topped with fresh cracked pepper. I ordered my filet medium rare, it came out medium. It was flavored nicely and was delicious. Had a chargrilled flavor. The two pieces of broccolini were good, however I don't prefer to eat the stock as it was hard. The buckeye dessert was delicious! Light peanut butter mouse like  with chocolate ganache.

The aroma/odor is the only thing that my husband and I did not like about Cut 132; however, everything else was top-notch! Service - Our waitress, Sherry, was absolutely amazing! She had the best personality, went over everything on the drink/food menu with us, and was super hospitable! Love, love, loved her! Drinks - We loved our drinks! My husband had the Cut & Smoked Old Fashioned and I had the White-Collar Crimes. The White Collar Crimes was basically a spiked red sangria served with a Martha Stewart CBD gummy. I also had the Bumps and Bubbles which was a bump of caviar served with icy champagne (for $35). I learned that I am not a fan of caviar; however, enjoyed the experience of finally getting the chance to try caviar! Food - Complimentary Bread: The complimentary bread was served with butter topped with black Hawaiian salt. It was good! We also used some of the leftover pieces of the complimentary bread with pieces from our charcuterie board. Charcuterie Board: We loves all of the pieces on our charcuterie board. Some of my faves were the blueberry vanilla goat cheese, the spicy peach jam, and the pickled yellow peppers! My husband described the charcuterie board the best - it was full of savory, sweet, and sour flavors! Ribeye: My husband ordered the ribeye. He ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection! Mashed Potatoes: My husband also ordered the mashed potatoes. These were nice and creamy. Short Rib: This was my dish. The description states ""Korean spices, creamy mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, and roasted broccoli"".  This is the perfect description of the dish - everything complimented each other well in the dish; however, I did not ""taste"" any Korean spices (and I'm Korean). It was still delicious though! Flourless Chocolate Cake: This was super chocolatey and good! The cake was served with a candle to blow out for our 6-year wedding anniversary (even though we ordered it to go!

I had forgotten all about Sidebar and how great food the food is.  We decided to grab some early dinner before a concert at the Southern Theatre. We had made reservations in advanced and parked in the Columbus Commons parking garage for the evening but there were meter parking spots around.We were greeted upon arrival and promptly seated.  Cute interior and such a nice atmosphere. The bar area and some seating when you first walk in, but we sat in the dinning area in the back section. The service as good, but a little slow. There were several times we wondered if our server was going to be back but he was extremely friendly and was great overall.  He asked if we were going to one of the two shows and after discussing which one and the start time he mentioned he would have our checks on the table no later than 6:30pm so we could make the 7pm show just in case time got away from us.They have dinner plates and/or sharable tapas plates. In addition to any beverages, my partner and I decided on ordering 5 tapas plates to share and it was plenty of food (with some potatoes to spare).I recommend all of these choices, not a bad one of the bunch:     -Chicken Skewers ($13) and these were delicious. Grilled and topped with a chimichurri sauce. This was one of my favorites.     -Spicy Potatoes ($10) with a nice spicy garlic aioli sauce. I thought these were a generous portion and enjoyed the onions and peppers with them.     -Shrimp & Garlic Sauce ($14) - these were a little messy and those chilies are hot! Careful if you grab a whole one.      -Cheese Empanadas ($12) and these were surprising another one of my favorites. Simple and perfect.     -Beef Meatball ($13) which was also good and i was a fan of the marinara sauce and loved the grilled baguette.It was a great dinner and prelude to our evening and can't wait to come back.

Could easily be missed if you're just driving through, especially since downtown tends to be quiet.The hostess, bartenders, and servers were all nice and helpful. We sat at the bar for happy hour and were given menus and explanations of various offerings. I got sangria, which was really good and had very fresh, sweet berries (even in the winter). We also shared a few dishes which were the cilantro hummus, beef empanadas, and ceviche. I love cilantro and thought the hummus was great, very herbal and punchy. The beef empanadas were also tasty and came with a sauce that, personally, could have used more spice. The ceviche wasn't super impressive to me, could have used more salt and maybe more of a vessel to eat with it.I will say, cost wise, its a bit on the higher end, even for happy hour but food and drink were mostly worth the price. Definitely a tucked away bar worth checking out!","OH, OH",4,31,950

The bar and immediate dining area are a bit snug, but I believe there is additional seating for more formal dinner around the corner of the bar in the rear of the restaurant. If it's your first time visiting, the entrance is located on the side of the building near the alley. The ambiance is elevated and we felt as though we were no longer in Columbus. Now, for the food. The beef empanadas were tasty, well-seasoned, and fairly substantial, but the dipping sauce could have had more of a kick. Ask for hot sauce or bring your own, perhaps. The cilantro hummus was refreshing and my personal favorite of the night. You receive a generous helping of pita bread to go along with it. We also had the white fish ceviche (not pictured), which was again very fresh and a bit buttery. All of the above would work great as tapas or appetizers for a small group. The Moscow mule was pretty strong for a happy hour special as well.Their happy hour menu is included below as of December 2023.

And it was the best decision. The restaurant's reservation system does not allow party size of 8 or more - however, this was easily resolved with a simple text on the reservation site, which Sidebar accommodated immediately. We had a one-hour window before our show, and it was as if the staff at Sidebar is trained to deal with patrons in a hurry. Upon arrival, our group was quickly seated, and orders taken promptly. Sidebar has a great happy hour menu, and our group ordered several tapas to share. All the dishes (there were 12 separate tapas) arrived hot, fresh, and most importantly - on time. We were impressed at the kitchen and service staff's pace and accuracy. The food was good too! Our table ordered the beef empanadas, the cheese empanadas, the chicken croquettes, the plantains, queso and guava, the chicken skewers, the shrimp with garlic sauce, and the calamari tapas. Everything was excellent; however, the chicken croquettes and the plantains were my favorites. Several people in our group also ordered dessert (the coco flan, and the Tres leches cake) and coffee (espresso and regular black coffee), which everyone enjoyed.

"Koshary King","https://www.yelp.com/biz/koshary-king-columbus?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Richard P.",4,"2020-11-06","Koshary King occupies a modest-sized white trailer at the intersection of Hudson & Summit, in the parking lot just north of Punk Pigs.  The trailer showed up a few days ago; there's a whiteboard menu in front, plus a pretty solid website on the internets.Their tagline is ""Egyptian Street Food"", so it's not surprising to find hummus, baba ghanouj, and falafel on the menu.  The hummus and baba ghanouj are pretty solid renditions of the type; nicely-made, with a generous helping of olive oil, and a side of crispy pita chips to dip them in.Koshary King also has a couple of dishes on their menu that I haven't encountered before in C'bus; their namesake koshary, and mesaka'a.  The mesaka'a is a mix of fried eggplant and peppers, with tomato, served room temperature with pita chips for dipping.  It's light and subtle and fresh, and a nice side dish.  The koshary is a mix of rice, 3 kinds of pasta (angel hair, spaghetti, and macaroni), and lentils, topped with a spicy tomato sauce, fried onions, and chickpeas.  If you're looking to carbo load, this is the dish for you.  It's a lot of food; I got two servings out of my takeout plate of koshary.  Initially, I wasn't that impressed by it, but it grew on me - the second day serving seemed tastier than the first night, as if the flavors had blended together.  Personally, I'd like a little more of the spicy tomato sauce and fried onions, and maybe a little less pasta.  Maybe Koshary King will read this review, and adjust their proportions a little bit.Koshary King's version of falafel was surprisingly good - a generous helping of coarse, chunky falafel served in a nice tender pita, with a smear of hummus, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles.  I've had a lot of falafel in C'bus, and this was definitely one of the best I've had.The also have a few dessert selections.  The rice pudding was simple but tasty; since my first visit, they've added a second rice pudding, which is oven-baked to finish.  It's a dollar more, but definitely worth the Washington.  The basboosa is a cake made of semolina wheat, with some dried coconut, and a bit of syrup.  It's one of my new favorite things in C'bus; sweet without being cloying, and elevated because of the coconut.  Definitely don't miss this.As we head into a challenging autumn, with the pandemic on the upswing, it's a pleasant surprise to discover a place like Koshary King.  It's nice to know that people are still taking chances, opening new businesses, and serving the food that they grew up with.  It's one of the things I really love about Columbus.  Koshary King is a great addition, and I'm happy to have them in the neighborhood.","Columbus, OH",119,221,2647

Added name to the list, and ended up heading to the crowded bar to wait. On the way there, a milkshake creating a river on the ground, with its accompanying slip hazard cone, had to be traversed. This sticky, chaotic river flowed across the floor through the visit.Once at the bar, service was quite slow, but that's alright, they're busy. However, the game was not on any of the tvs, and when a bartender was asked, they said ""maybe"" they could put it on. I will add that The Crew lists Goodwood Brewing as an official spot to watch the game. Odd, right? Anyhow, eventually food comes and I'm just deflated recounting the meal, the ""jumbo"" wings were hilariously small - quite literally the smallest I've ever seen! I really don't know where you can even source wings that small these days, considering the size of farmed poultry. Again, so odd. As the evening went on, the crowd thinned, tables were left dirty. The place felt understaffed, mismanaged, falsely advertised, apathetic, and near death. I recommend you hasten their passing and give yourself a chance of a good evening by NOT GOING.

I feel like they have potential to be good but they just are not there yet. I went with some friends before a concert and they were not staffed enough for the crowd that they had. It took almost an hour to get our food. We got a few appetizers. We got the Bavarian pretzel with Louisville Lager beer cheese, IPA beer mustard, garlic oil. My favorite was the GoodWood Tochos with Louisville Lager beer cheese, peppers, onions, pickledjalapeño, pickled onions, topped with ranch. They were so good but I would ask for a lighter portion of jalapeños are they were everywhere. We also got the bacon beer cheese fries. All great options. For my main meal, I got the GoodWood hamburger with fried pickled jalapeños, pimento cheese, and bacon. The hamburgers are double stacked but I didn't love my hamburger and after the wait didn't love it as much. If I ever go again, I would try the drunken chicken sub for hamburger. It's so close to the Jackets stadium that they either need to get their act together on staffing and get their food out in a timely manner or they will not get customers.

All 3 times I've been here I have had generally positive experiences. I will say I've tried about 5 of their beers and have never been blown away which is odd considering they're a brewery. But their mixed drinks are good and they have a list of cans and bottles as well.By and large their standout is anything with beer cheese. The pretzel with beer cheese is soooo good, although the happy hour pretzel bites is a very sad and small portion for $6. The beer cheese mac and cheese is genuinely the best thing on their menu. I've so far tried the drunken chicken sandwich, the pulled pork, and the mac melt. All 3 have been really good, but the max melt is my favorite. The tots and fries are both good with a unique seasoning blend. Service here has always been good for us even when they are super busy before CBJ games which is when we have visited. I will say the bathrooms could use a lot of work. The floor is always sticky and the toilet paper isn't in the dispensers it's just in rolls on top of it.

The pretzel was ok cheese not worth the cost. The beer was drinkable and cold I doubt should be classified as an ipa. Mild flavored. By now we are over an hour into our visit.

All the tables, chairs, and almost everything else was reused. However, there were some serious upgrades in the menu department. The Goodwood burger had so much flavor and was just the right amount of spicy with the jalapeños. It came with fries which were cooked well and dusted with a seasoning that gave them a lot of flavor. We also had the sweet potato beignets, which were very tasty. If you've been to New Orleans and had a Cafe Du Monde beignet, it's not really the same.

So we search and search and we found this location he explained to me.  Let me start with They do not honor the 10% discount coupon that you get from Yelp.  This is one of his favorite dishes that he could not find it in Ohio.  So while he was talking I looked up and yelped it. Found the location and took him to it.  When we arrived you had to wait to be seated which was wasn't a long wait.  The menu was very clear with clear pictures in English and in Spanish The prices were rather expensive for what they offer. He even said it was high. Mofongo  is like a mashed up plantain which is pretty good. The only issue I had with my dish was they didn't have enough stew sauce for the mofongo. You don't really get a lot of meat for the price you pay. However, the dish was okay for me. I like more bold flavors. I did add some of their special blend of hot sauce. I also understand they don't really do spicy in his culture which is okay for me. It needed just a little bit more bold flavors and it's a little overpriced for what you get.  The restaurant sits off by itself so you can't really miss it but it's on a back street. In closing as always, is this a place that I would take a friend from out of town? Yes I would. If they were of Latin descent I would take them so they can experience it and let me know the differences.  I will let them know it is pricey.

After several attempts we asked to speak with the manager when he arrived he gave us the solution and also changed our waiter, the second waitress was actually not much better than the other since for almost the rest of the dinner she did not take care of cleaning the table, we had to pick things up and put them on other tables around until I cleaned them.

Came with plenty of oyster crackers.  Then I went with a sub because everyone said they're good; why not have the Louie 2, a basic Italian sub plus capicola and spicy sausage?  The sausage is not really spicy, and it's ground, so some fell off but it's surprisingly not too messy in general.  Good bread, good toppings, overstuffed (I bet the normal one has enough meat to satisfy, but the sausage does add some oomph.)  So big I took half home (if I'd skipped the chili I could have finished it, but would have been stuffed.)  Reasonable prices, good service considering it seems like there was only one person there for about 20 patrons total at tables and the bar.  It's not fancy, but it's good.  Parking is tight, and you can't park in the lot next door (the vet) till the evening.  They have bands on the weekend, but I can't imagine how- it's tight enough on a not too busy weekday.","Columbus, OH",24,7,1224

My wife and I dined for the cider time at The Mercury Diner today, and our experience was both over stimulating and underwhelming. Our server was mostly on top of it, but she lacked personality and seemed to really just not give a damn. The drinks: I started with the Bloody Mary, which was served to me without the candied bacon it advertised, no straw, and a TON of finely crushed iced. Every sip I took from the top was just watered down tomato juice. I eventually snagged a straw, but still had trouble getting any of the drink, the ice just kept clogging the straw. My wife had a mimosa, but the orange bitters overpowered the actual OJ in the drink, and it ended up just tasting like artificial orange. The coffee had been a highlight in online reviews, so we ordered 2 cups for $8. It was warm but not hot. I asked for real half and half, after just seeing cups of coffee mate on the table. The server said she didn't think they had any and walked away. The food: we had no silverware when it arrived, but after we were able to get some, we dug in. I had the cosmic breakfast and added a side of ""crispy bacon"". The bacon was two, maybe three (?) small pieces of limp bacon all stuck together. My eggs were burnt to a crisp on the bottom and just straight runny whites on top. The tres leches cake slice served with the meal was dry, which is ironic. The fruit was not ripe. My wife's Mediterranean Moon omelet was so overdone that the scrambled eggs were tough. The hummus was bitey. The decor was cute, but that's where it ends.The music was so loud that we could hardly talk to one another at the small table. Overall, this is one of the worst breakfasts I've had in Columbus, and it came to $61.26 before tip. I left feeling gross and disappointed.","Columbus, OH",271,140,1819

I frequent this particular market in the regular and happened to observe this new restaurant, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The establishment doesn't give off your traditionall sandwich or burger vibe. The layout is somewhat sterile but it has a certain je ne sais quoi. Service was pretty good, quick and friendly and I have no complaints. Everyone behind the counter were extremely and helpful. For my meal, I will be honest and tell you I did a little too much but it was definitely worth the extra calories. I had a burger, Philly cheese steak sandwich, fries and tator tots. I was not a fan of the fries so I'll give those 4/10. The flavor was not hitting and mine at least were a little over done. The tator tots  were pretty good. The were seasoned well, crispy/crunchy, and done on the inside. 8/10The burger. Listen that burger was thee best burger tgat I've had to Date. I sat at the table upstairs with some friends and when they looked over at and saw my eyes closed with a slight moan, they said the burger must be good. It had that flame broiled taste that not many have been able to master and seasoned to perfection. I still dream about this burger 10/10The wings... Whew. I got the mild and garlic parmesan. I was more partial to the mild wings, but both were good. A slight crispiness and done. I was licking my fingers afterwards. 8.5/10The Philly cheesesteak was pretty awesome. It had a mild flavor to it. All I got was the cheese and the meat, and it seemed like a high quality combination. The bread was a little less to be desired.","Columbus, OH",1188,388,1634

Imagine sticky rice mixed with egg stuck into a seaweed quesadilla, covered in panko crumbs, but still made into a flat shape, then deep fried. Two of those pieces become the 'bread', the inside is layered with avocado and spicy tuna, salmon, crab, or veggies, it's cut into quarters, then voila. A sushi panini.I absolutely love them and ordered one of each to share with friends at a dinner party recently-- they were a hit. Definitely ask for wasabi because they do not come with it.The ramen... just isn't great. I won't go into too much detail but just go to a ramen spot for that. Oshio isn't that.

The place is still a super cute, friendly neighborhood spot, but as of April 2023, they had changed up their kitchen, significantly, so I was a bit disappointed.  There used to be some cool bowls and salads.  The new menu is very brief, maybe a dozen or so items, and the focus is wings.  So, one of the girls got wings and sweet potato fries.  I got the chicken bites.  We were pretty pleased to find that they had a side salad option, and that it was a good quality side salad, served in a cute little ramekin, which does make it taste better.  Yes, I know I'm ridiculous, but it was so darn cute.  But the veg were really fresh and crunchy, so good choice.  The chicken bites were not what I expected - they were better.  I thought they were boneless wings, but it was chopped grilled tenders tossed in wing sauce  (garlic parm, please).  It was a nice surprise.  Note that the sweet potato fries are sprinkled with sugar and I do prefer mine savory, so it might not be your cup of tea.  Service was friendly and quick, and it was fairly empty, but with some rowdy folks on a weeknight.","Cleveland, OH",48,556,1213

It was a perfect addition to our entrees for only $4, and packed with flavor. Biscuit was so fluffy and the meat was well cooked.The double cheeseburger was huge and had great toppings.

It is located in a strip mall and has a little patio in front with some umbrellas. It does not have any heaters, so it would only be good in the warmer months. There was plenty of parking as the other businesses were closed by the time we arrived. On the inside it has some high tables with a bench on one side and high-top chairs on the other. The bar is located on the other side and has plenty of seats and televisions. Our server was nice and friendly.  Big surprise, we started out with drinks. I got a whiskey sour with Makers Mark and a couple of cherries, to make it a wee bit sweeter. My man got a Yeungling draft, one of his regular beers. We shared the Beer Pretzel Bites, they were delicious. Oh, so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, it even came with two ramekins of cheese. There was some cheese left over, which usually never happens. For my meal I got a cup of French Onion Soup and the Italian Chicken Sandwich. The croutons on the soup were large and crunchy, and there was a ton of melted cheese on top. I ordered the cup and it appeared to almost be bowl size. The chicken was grilled, with red peppers, lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese and some pesto aioli. The bread was something I had never seen before, grilled tomato swirl beard, like a marble rye. YUMMY!My man got the Counter Burger with American cheese, lettuce, tomato and red onion on a grilled bun, with a side of onion rings. It also came with a pickle spear on the side. Everything must have been good because he ate it all and did not even save me a bite, lol.   We will definitely be back a couple of times.

"Over the Counter","https://www.yelp.com/biz/over-the-counter-worthington?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Jim H.",4,"2019-12-03","It's been a while since I initially reviewed Over the Counter. Just a few things have changed and it's mostly for the better. The menu has been expanded, which is great. (Especially since the wife and I visit almost once a week.) A couple of additional vegetarian options have been added. As someone who leans toward vegetarian, I fully support that change. Plus a few 'daily specials' have also become mainstays on the menu. I still recommend checking the board just inside the front door for daily specials. Some reviews have mentioned spotty service, which I have encountered a few of the many times I have been to Over the Counter. What I have found is that service at the bar is consistently the best. Plus, it puts you closer to where the drinks are! Bonus!A note about coffee at OTC: They are still serving One Line coffee, which makes me a happy person (because it's a great Columbus company). The beans are ground in house, weighed, and made in a french press that's timed. As a slightly obsessed coffee lover, this makes me happy. On busy brunch days OTC does pre-grind, portion coffee into containers, and decant the pressed into air pots. However, the difference in taste would be negligible to most folks (when compared with the ground just before pressing). Over the Counter also features Falters products, Lucky Cat bread, and what I am pretty sure is local hot teas.","Westerville, OH",67,1022,1382
"Over the Counter","https://www.yelp.com/biz/over-the-counter-worthington?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Hada O.",4,"2018-07-14","This place is solid. Name a meal and I have eaten it here. Service is quite attentive and the food is made to order. The beer is also reasonably priced compared to many other brunch/beer spots.Brunch: Over the Counter is my favorite place in the neighborhood to brunch. I have been I've gotten quite a few of their Benedict offerings. Their hollandaise is well done. Once, I was served eggs that were not poached as they should have been but it was quickly rectified.  The biscuits and sausage gravy features a pretty great gravy. Nicely spiced fresh local sausage. Of course, from my Southerner prospective, were ho hum. To be fair, I don't expect to be wowed by biscuits when I order them north of N. Carolina. Over the Counter serves One Line's beans in a timed french press. This is what I want to see in places that I go for brunch. After all, what is a meal that is paired with coffee if they coffee is subpar? One Line is quite possibly my favorite roaster in Columbus (aside from what we roast at home) due to their sourcing and commitment to a consistent roast. OTC is great for times other than brunch. Lunch/Dinner/Snacks: I have eaten my way though a lot of the menu here.  Here's just a few thoughts as to not make this an essay review. :)The fried veggies, are house made. I've only gotten them once but, the breading was too thick so it was not quite done on some parts of the broccoli. This could be a fluke, as everything else that's come from the fryer here as been served done. I just let it slide but I know that if I had brought it to the attention of employees that it would have been fixed. Their onion rings are great. Well balanced batter vs onion and well fried. Pretzel bites are tossed into the fryer which give an interesting texture. The texture works though and compliments the beer cheese.Huge bonus for these guys is that their hot dog isn't Vienna beef it's a legit kosher beef dog. It takes a little work to locate beef dogs that aren't Vienna in this area. It's a massive dog too so if you're thinking about getting it you may need a box.I enjoy the salads on the menu here as well. The half salad is quite sizeable. The full size salads are always two meals for me. My go to salads are the Caesar and the Route 23. I have found that the Route 23 dressing oddly sweet by itself but paired with the salad, it works exceedingly well. The balsamic onions and the spring mix neutralized the sweetness which brought the salad together. The strawberries were a perfect topping which matches well with the candied nuts and fried goat cheese.  Speaking of the candied walnuts, I really appreciate that OTC even makes the simple things like croutons, their candied walnuts, dressings, candied bacon, etc. At the bottom of the menu they even have noted some of the local partners that they use. Like Lucky Cat Bakery breads (they're in Granville). P.S. Everyday at OTC there is a happy hour: 1/2 off most beer 2-7 daily wine special and a buck off house liquor.","Columbus, OH",1,11,2987

I'd describe it as a typical diner except for the fact that they have a full bar with 10 beers on tap (8 microbrews plus a cider and Pabst Blue Ribbon).  The menu is classic diner fare - many sandwiches, soups, and salads.The wife opted for the cream of chicken with rice soup and their 23 salad.

They have Velvet, in many flavors.  And, since we were there anyway (and ignoring the leftovers waiting at home) I got a Jamaican beef patty for the road.  It came out piping hot, so it ended up waiting for the table at home, but it is handy for eating while driving- a pocket of crispy crust, with seasoned, finely-ground beef inside.  I've had them before, here and elsewhere, and they aren't made from scratch, but they're tasty and filling, and this one was cooked to order.Friendly service.  Ice cream, chicken wings, burgers, cheesesteaks, and more.  It's an old Dairy Queen building, so no indoor dining, but a few tables out front and a big lot.  Careful when there's traffic- Sunbury can be busy.  Best to pull out onto Holt, which you can do now (there used to be a barrier.)

So glad I finally made it with my husband. The service was great and not too busy on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch at 3pm. I asked our server for recommendations and he went through and asked our spice level preference and then suggested the sauces. His recommendations were perfect, we enjoyed our chicken a lot.We ordered only chicken. We ordered the spicy garlic in wings and the curry snow in drums. The spicy garlic is spicy, yet has a perfect sweetness to balance it out. The curry chicken had a great flavor. The curry was my favorite. We never had fried chicken with the savory, saucy onions, so decided to get that on the curry drums. I think if ordering the snow onions, I would suggest getting it with the drums, so you have enough meat to enjoy the onions with. Next time, I would leave the onions out. The chicken itself I found to be tender and cooked well. The batter is not too thick, yet very crunchy, which I found to be perfect. Looking forward to going again for their chicken.

To accommodate other's preferences, I didn't really get what I wanted. I ended up getting the Soy Tikkudak. By design, it's fried and then baked which made the chicken drier than I prefer. Seemingly everyone loves the Snow Onion, but it was too much onion for me. A dish that pleasantly surprised me was the cheese monster. Cheese and chicken aren't really the most intuitive combo, but it worked well... to the point where I used the sauce on my Tikkudak. I'm definitely willing to give this place another shot. I think if I order a saucier, spicier, less onion forward array of chicken, I'll be all good.

Some areas are well furnished, others strangely stark and cold. I've been several times now and still can't figure out what it wants to be, but maybe that's up to the clientele to make it what they want.There are a LOT of cornhole boards, casual sets near the front and what appears to be league play in the big room. There are three different bars, the one in the big room not always operating. There are free golf simulators, ping pong, giant checkers/chess at the back of the main bar. There are other games that are not free. There is food that is pretty good, but expensive. There are beers and drinks that are pretty good, but expensive. The staff seems nice and welcoming most of the time.Parking is available on the street out front, in a nearby pay lot, or on neighboring streets with the Park CBUS app.One really aggravating thing is that they automatically add a 20% tip to your bill, but unless you're paying really close attention you won't see that they've done it so you tip 20% more on top and end up paying a ton.

Nicely spacious with cool retro backed-benches for comfy seating when the weather turns. Four large fire pits spread out. I can only imagine this place will get prime use come summer with all the conventions and whatnot going on across the street. Five words: Pimento Cheese In A Jar. The sausage marmalade paired really when with the savory cheese. And the jar was a neat touch. The very thin crunchy lavosh crackers had a tasty flavor on there own. Being thin, no worries about filling up in bulk bread - the helping of the cheese mesh up took the stage. Hour hour (M-F, 4-6 pm) gets you half-off their snacks, so the appetizer was sizable for $4.50. Looking through the entire menu, prices seemed very reasonable. A few other offerings caught my eye, so I'd definitely return for round two. I didn't see the breakfast menu, nor saw a separate lunch menu (the evening menu must hold for lunch, too?), so a hearty morning meal also leaves me intrigued.","Columbus, OH",897,1884,2169

"Flip Side","https://www.yelp.com/biz/flip-side-columbus-2?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","Laura F.",5,"2023-12-27","Flip Side is a burger joint in Easton Town Center.  It's located around the corner/behind Pottery Barn and Banana Republic.   There is curbside parking with meters as well as a small lot right directly outside of it that has free parking.  This is a great place to come to if you want a good burger.  It has a true burger joint/bar type of vibe    They have many varieties to choose from.  They make burgers with the following protiens: angus, bison, turkey, impossible patty. The buns are always fresh.  For people who might not be into burgers they have chicken, grouper and 3-4 salads.  (I recommend the Kale but ask for extra chickpeas).  My only complaint here is: food timing seems off.   Now, service here is always friendly (the servers are great) but there is a bit of a disconnect often between the front of the house and the back...Orders seem to either back up or get unnecessarily delayed.   It seems to occur at a 1:2, 1:3 ratio. However once you get your order, the food is delicious.","New Albany, OH",66,203,999
"Flip Side","https://www.yelp.com/biz/flip-side-columbus-2?osq=Restaurants&start=0","True","David S.",3,"2024-03-02","Let's start with where this is! Easton is a destination for about anything you would want to buy, from Walmart to Tiffany and Co! Even Land Rover Tesla and other high end makes! This is a great location and great concept! Now for the atmosphere! The music was way to loud for anyone to talk, to a point we heard the conversations of the tables around us! The seating close to the partially open kitchen is also added noise but also the traffic around your table! The smells from the kitchen were off putting to us and another table, I as a chef know what it was, but a lot of people don't! The truffle fries they sell are very overpowering through that end of the restaurant! Not everyone loves truffle! The seating and tables were nice but showing age of being open over ten years! They have TV's with a couple of games on and a betting line was on one tv. Now for the most important part the food! We drove to buy a car in Easton and the dealership raved about the food! We like to try local places not big chains to see what the area is about! Now with that said we not tried recommended burgers from waitstaff and workers at the dealership. We tried the Mikey Burger bacon,pepper Jack, onion ring and house done version of a  remoulade. The concept of this burger was great and had a decent taste, and the sweet potato fries were ordered because they were raved about by the dealership and server. I will finish this thought after the next plate! The other burger was the Flip Side burger also with bacon, aged cheddar, charred balsamic red onions with a house made bbq sauce! Regular fries. Again great concept but here in lies the issue with this place! The burgers came out Luke warm, fries on both plates cold, to a point where we tried them but did not finish them! The burgers must have sat in the pass because the bottoms of the buns were soggy and a mess to eat! The balsamic onions were refrigerator cold, I never could ask if there were supposed to be warmed up!Now the biggest complaint, the service! Our server was nice enough polite and informative, but as far as attentive he was not! The food runner was more attentive! The server let us run out of drinks and never checked to see how the food was, he was busy standing at the bar chatting with other servers! It took 25 minutes for our food to come and the three tables around us that were seated after us were served food before us! The other tables ordered drinks from the bar and they seemed to get preferential treatment because of that. I would say this place could be a five rating if they worked a little harder at customer service and not letting people's food get cold in the pass! Even the onion rings on the Mikey burger were cold right out of the kitchen! Asked for a manager and that never happened We will give another chance on our next trip from Kentucky (which was not on our return to pick up the car we purchased a week later) but I hope it lives up to the hype the car dealers and other places recommend it for!!!","Versailles, KY",19,150,3003

The sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly, the mezcal cocktail was delicious, and I am a sucker for Brussels sprouts lol The temp of the meat ran a little pink for me and my friend, so I was glad I went with medium for my Black and Blue Burger. It was absolutely perfect! It's a little pricey on the whole, but not really when you consider the quality of ingredients. The decor was fine. Nothing to write home about. The guy delivering our food was awesome, our first server was polite and attentive, but our second server was barely present which was too bad because I was hoping to try a shake after we had been there a while.I wouldn't call this a destination burger, but if I'm at Easton I will definitely eat here again!","Columbus, OH",47,36,762

Great experience! Our server was attentive and we were seated at a high but not the highest level of tables. The truffle fries were tasty and a large portion for the price, we split them. I ordered the Brunch Burger and beef bacon, local egg, and the maple syrup added a lot to the Ohio beef patty. The hashbrowns were my last favorite topping but they were okay still. Take a look at their cocktail menu - it seems to rotate but the names are pretty funny. I ordered the 2 Star Yelp Review which was kind of a blackberry margarita and it was great.","Powell, OH",93,165,614

We were looking for a low key place and to try something new since we recently moved to the area.  While the service was great the food was just okay and I was a bit disappointed.  We went early so it was not crowded and we were seated at a booth immediately.  Our server was very good.  Just enough attention to us at the beginning and throughout the meal.  The day we had dinner was the first day of their new menu.  Since we had not been their before the new items were new and so were the former items; however, one noticeable change per our server was that the side items now come with the burgers meaning you don't order and pay for them separately.  A good piece of info!We ordered onion rings to start and the flavor was very good but there was way too much breading.  I had one ring that was not cooked all the way through because the breading was so heavy.  The remoulade was good but too heavy when paired with the excess breading on the rings.I ordered the Impossible Burger without cheese, pointing to our menu for clarity when I did.  The burger that came out was good but over seasoned and missing the fixings that were shown on the menu (no avocado, sprouts, arugula, or red pepper vinaigrette).  Herein lies my disappointment.  My truffle fries were great, not too much truffle and just the right amount of seasoning.  My husband ordered the Forester Burger which came with a fried shiitake mushroom and truffle aioli.  He ordered medium and said it was ""tasty"".  While we may try Flip Side Burger again I suspect we will opt for trying something else local instead.","Columbus, OH",86,169,1652

The ordering system is the same, although they seem to be experimenting with the ordering robots that Hiro Ramen has- one of our orders arrived by robot. Food was pretty high quality, nothing arrived directly frozen and everything was pretty fresh. Only knock compared to K Pot was perhaps the soups which were a bit less flavorful here. Pretty certain they're still constructing and preparing for their full opening, saw/heard some angle grinder sparks on the other side of the restaurant which was interesting. Overall a good experience, and I'm to see more hot pot places in cbus- hope Pj sticks around!","Evanston, IL",75,23,854

They had a few different items compared to KPot...crawfish, octopus. The sauce bar is a good size with your standard sauces. Really enjoyed the chopped red and green chilies. Gave my sauce concoction just the right amount of spice. My kids were thrilled that they had individual cups of ice cream for dessert.Service was good. Never had to wait long for food.
